In unit 1, we studied the properties of charges when they are at rest. In reality, the charges are always moving within the materials. For example, the electrons in a copper wire are never at rest and are continuously in random motion. Therefore it is important to analyse the behaviour of charges when they are in motion. The motion of charges constitutes ‘electric current’. Current electricity is the study of flow of electric charges. It owes its origin to Alessandro Volta (1745-1827), who invented the electric battery which produced the first steady flow of electric current. Modern world depends heavily on the use of electricity. It is used to operate machines, communication systems, electronic devices, home appliances etc., In this unit, we will study about the electric current, resistance and related phenomenon in materials.




  

## ELECTRIC CURRENT

Matter is made up of atoms. Each atom consists of a positively charged nucleus with negatively charged electrons moving around the nucleus. Atoms in metals have one or more electrons which are loosely bound to the nucleus. These electrons are called free electrons and can be easily detached from the atoms. The substances which have an abundance of these free electrons are called conductors. These free electrons move randomly throughout the conductor at a given temperature. In general due to this random motion, there is no net transfer of charges from one end of the

conductor to other end and hence no current in the conductor. When a potential difference is applied by the battery across the ends of the conductor, the free electrons drift towards the positive terminal of the battery, producing a net electric current. This is easily understandable from the analogy given in the Figure 2.1.

In the XI Volume 2, unit 6, we studied, that the mass move from higher gravitational potential to lower gravitational potential. Likewise, positive charge flows from region of higher electric potential to region of lower electric potential and negative charge flows from region of lower electric potential to region of higher electric potential. So battery or electric cell simply creates potential difference across the conductor.

The electric current in a conductor is defined as the rate of flow of charges through a given cross-sectional area A. It is shown in the Figure 2.2.

flow is not always constant. Hence current can more generally be defined as

_I Q tavg_ \=

∆ ∆

(2.1)

Where ∆Q is the amount of charge that passes through the conductor at any cross section during the time interval ∆t. If the rate at which charge flows changes with time, the current also changes. The instantaneous current I is defined as the limit of the average current, as ∆_t_ ® 0

### Conventional Current

**Flow of electrons**

**\+ –**

In an electric circuit, arrow heads are used to indicate the direction of flow of current. By convention, this flow in the circuit should be from the positive terminal of the battery to the negative terminal. This current is called the conventional current or simply current and is in the direction in which a positive test charge would move. In typical circuits the charges that flow are actually electrons, from the negative terminal of the battery to the positive terminal. As a result, the flow of electrons and the direction of conventional current point in opposite direction as shown in Figure 2.3. Mathematically, a transfer of positive charge is the

same as a transfer of negative charge in the opposite direction.

Electric current is not only produced by batteries. In nature, lightning bolt produces enormous electric current in a short time. During lightning, very high potential difference is created between the clouds and ground and hence charges flow between the clouds and ground.

### Drift velocity

In a conductor the charge carriers are free electrons. These electrons move freely through the conductor and collide repeatedly with the positive ions. If there is no electric field, the electrons move in random directions, and hence their velocities are also randomly oriented. On an average, the number of electrons travelling in any direction will be equal to the number of electrons travelling in the opposite direction. As a result, there is no net flow of electrons in any direction and hence there will not be any current.

Suppose a potential difference is set across the conductor by connecting a battery, an electric field



_E_ is created in the conductor. This electric field exerts a force on the electrons, producing a current. The  

electric field accelerates the electrons, while ions scatter the electrons and change their direction of motion. Thus, we see zigzag motion of electrons. In addition to the zigzag motion due to the collisions, the electrons move slowly along the conductor in a direction opposite to that of



_E_ as shown in the Figure 2.4.

**Ions**

Any material is made up of neutral atoms with equal number of electrons and protons. If the outermost electrons leave the atoms, they become free electrons and are responsible for electric current. The atoms after losing their outer most electrons will have more positive charges and hence are called positive ions. These ions will not move freely within the material like the free electrons. Hence the positive ions will not give rise to current.

The SI unit of mobility is m V s 12 1- - .

The typical drift velocity of electrons in the wire is 10–4 m s–1. If an electron drifts with this speed, then the electrons

leaving the battery will take hours to reach the light bulb. Then how electric bulbs glow as soon as we switch on the battery? When battery is switched on, the electrons begin to move away from the negative terminal of the battery and this electron exerts force on the nearby electrons. This process creates a propagating influence (electric field) that travels through the wire at the speed of light. In other words, the energy is transported from the battery to bulb at the speed of light through propagating influence (electric field). Due to this reason, the bulb glows as soon as the battery is switched on.

**Note**  

**EXAMPLE 2.2**

If an electric field of magnitude 570 N C–1, is applied in the copper wire, find the acceleration experienced by the electron.

**Misconception** (i) There is a common misconception that

the battery is the source of electrons. It is not true. When a battery is connected across the given wire, the electrons in the closed circuit resulting the current. Battery sets the potential difference (electrical energy) due to which these electrons in the conducting wire flow in a particular direction. The resulting electrical energy is used by electric bulb, electric fan etc. Similarly the electricity board is supplying the electrical energy to our home.

(ii) We often use the phrases like ‘charging the battery in my mobile’ and ‘my mobile phone battery has no charge’ etc. These sentences are not correct.

When we say ‘battery has no charge’, it means, that the battery has lost ability to provide energy or provide potential difference to the electrons in the circuit. When we say ‘mobile is charging’, it implies that the battery is receiving energy from AC power supply and not electrons.

### Microscopic model of current

Consider a conductor with area of cross section A and let an electric field



_E_ be applied to it from right to left. Suppose there are _n_ electrons per unit volume in the conductor and assume that all the electrons move with the same drift velocity _vd_ as shown in Figure 2.5.

The drift velocity of the electrons = _vd_ If the electrons move through a distance

_dx_ within a small interval of _dt,_ then

_vd_ = _dx dt_

; _dx_ = _vd dt_ (2.7)

Since A is the area of cross section of the conductor, the electrons available in the volume of length _dx_ is

\= volume × number of electrons per unit volume

\= _Adx n_´ (2.8)  

Substituting for _dx_ from equation (2.7) in (2.8)

\= (_A vd dt_ ) _n_ Total charge in the volume element _dQ_ =

(charge) × (number of electrons in the volume element)

_dQ_ = (_e_)(_Avddt_)_n_

Hence the current _I dQ dt_

**Current density (J)** The current density ( _J_ ) is defined as the current per unit area of cross section of the conductor.

(or) A m–2

**EXAMPLE 2.3**

Why current density is a vector but current is a scalar?

In general, the current I is defined as the scalar product of the current density and area vector in which the charges cross.

The current I can be positive or negative depending on the choice of the unit vector normal to the surface area A.

When a potential difference _V_ is applied across the wire, a net electric field is created in the wire which constitutes the current in the wire. For simplicity, we assume that the electric field is uniform in the entire length of the wire, then the potential difference (voltage _V_) can be written as

_V = El_

As we know, the magnitude of current density

_J E V l_

\= =σ σ (2.14)

But _J I A_

\= ,

so we write the equation (2.14) as

_I A_

_V l_

\= σ .

By rearranging the above equation, we get

_V I l A_

\= 

  

 σ (2.15)

The quantity _l A_σ

is called resistance of

the conductor and it is denoted as _R_. Note that the resistance is directly proportional to the length of the conductor and inversely proportional to area of cross section.

Therefore, the macroscopic form of ohm’s law can be stated as

_V = IR_ (2.16)

From the above equation, **the resistance is the ratio of potential difference across the given conductor to the current passing through the conductor.**

_R V I_

\= (2.17)

The SI unit of resistance is ohm (Ω). From the equation (2.16), we infer that the graph between current versus voltage is  

straight line with a slope equal to the inverse of resistance _R_ of the conductor. It is shown in the Figure 2.8 (a).

Materials for which the current versus voltage graph is a straight line through the origin, are said to obey Ohm’s law and their behaviour is said to be ohmic as shown in Figure 2.8(a). Materials or devices that do not follow Ohm’s law are said to be non- ohmic. These materials have more complex relationships between voltage and current. A plot of I versus V for a non-ohmic material is non-linear and they do not have a constant resistance (Figure 2.8(b)).

### Resistivity

In the previous section, we have seen that the resistance _R_ of any conductor is given by

_R l A_

\= σ

(2.18)

where _σ_ is called the conductivity of the material and it depends only on the type of the material used and not on its dimension.

The resistivity of a material is equal to the reciprocal of its conductivity.

ρ σ

\= 1 (2.19)

Now we can rewrite equation (2.18) using equation (2.19)

_R l A_

\= ρ (2.20)

The resistance of a material is directly proportional to the length of the conductor and inversely proportional to the area of cross section of the conductor. The  

proportionality constant ρ is called the resistivity of the material.

If _l_ = 1 m and _A_ = 1 m2, then the resistance _R = ρ_. In other words, the **electrical resistivity of a material is defined as the resistance offered to current flow by a conductor of unit length having unit area of cross section.** The SI unit of _ρ_ is ohm-metre (Ω m). Based on the resistivity, materials are classified as conductors, insulators and semi- conductors. The conductors have lowest resistivity, insulators have highest resistivity and semiconductors have resistivity greater than conductors but less than insulators. The typical resistivity values of some conductors, insulators and semiconductors are given in the Table 2.1

### Resistors in series and parallel

An electric circuit may contain a number of resistors which can be connected in different ways. For each type of circuit, we can calculate the equivalent resistance produced by a group of individual resistors.

**Resistors in series** When two or more resistors are connected

end to end, they are said to be in series. The resistors could be simple resistors or bulbs or heating elements or other devices. Figure 2.9 (a) shows three resistors _R_1, _R_2 and _R_3 connected in series.

The amount of charge passing through resistor _R_1 must also pass through resistors _R_2 and _R_3 since the charges cannot accumulate anywhere in the circuit. Due to

this reason, the current I passing through all the three resistors is the same. According to Ohm’s law, if same current pass through different resistors of different values, then the potential difference across each resistor must be different. If _V_1, _V_2 and _V_3 be the potential differences (voltage) across each of the resistors _R_1, _R_2 and _R_3 respectively, then we can write _V_1 = _IR_1, _V_2 = _IR_2 and _V_3 = _IR_3\. But the supply voltage _V_ must be equal to the sum of voltages(potential differences) across each resistor.

_V_ = _V_1 + _V_2 + _V_3 = _IR_1 + _IR_2 + _IR_3 (2.21)

_V_ = _I_ (_R_1 + _R_2 + _R_3)

_V_ = _IRS_ (2.22)

where _RS_ is the equivalent resistance.

_RS_\= _R_1 + _R_2 + _R_3 (2.23)

When several resistors are connected in series, the total or equivalent resistance is the sum of the individual resistances as shown in the Figure 2.9 (b).

**Note: The value of equivalent resistance in series connection will be greater than each individual resistance.**

**EXAMPLE 2.8**

**Resistors in parallel** Resistors are in parallel when they are connected across the same potential difference as shown in Figure 2.10 (a).

In this case, the total current I that leaves the battery is split into three separate components. Let _I_1, _I_2 and _I_3 be the current through the resistors _R_1, _R_2 and _R_3 respectively. Due to the conservation of charge, total current in the circuit I is equal to sum of the currents through each of the three resistors.

_I_ = _I_1 + _I_2 + _I_3 (2.24)

Since the voltage across each resistor is the same, applying Ohm’s law to each resistor, we have

**Note: The value of equivalent resistance in parallel connection will be lesser than each individual resistance.**

House hold appliances are always connected in parallel so that even if one is switched off, the other devices could function properly.

It implies that the 5 Ω has no role in determining the equivalent resistance and it can be removed. So the circuit is simplified as shown in the figure.

### Colour code for Carbon resistors

![Resistances used in laboratory](2.11.png "")

Carbon resistors consists of a ceramic core, on which a thin layer of crystalline carbon is deposited as shown in Figure 2.11. These resistors are inexpensive, stable and compact in size. Colour rings are used to indicate the value of the resistance according to the rules given in the Table 2.2.

Three coloured rings are used to indicate the values of a resistor: the first two rings are significant figures of resistances, the third ring indicates the decimal multiplier after them. The fourth colour, silver or gold,

shows the tolerance of the resistor at 10% or 5% as shown in the Figure 2.12 .If there is no fourth ring, the tolerance is 20%.

For the resistor shown in Figure 2.12, the first digit = 5 (green), the second digit = 6 (blue), decimal multiplier = 103 (orange) and tolerance = 5% (gold). The value of resistance = 56 × 103 Ω or 56 kΩ with the tolerance value 5%.

While reading the colour code, hold the resistor with colour bands to your left. Resistors

never start with a metallic band on the left.

### Temperature dependence of resistivity

The resistivity of a material is dependent on temperature. It is experimentally found that for a wide range of temperatures, the resistivity of a conductor increases with increase in temperature according to the expression,

ρ ρ α_T T T_\= + −( ) 

  

1 (2.27)

where ρ_T_ is the resistivity of a conductor at _T_ o_C_, ρ_o_ is the resistivity of the conductor at some reference temperature _To_ (usually at 20oC) and _α_ is the temperature coefficient of resistivity. **It is defined as the ratio of increase in resistivity per degree rise in temperature to its resistivity at To**_._

From the equation (2.27), we can write

where _∆_ρ _=_ ρ_T –_ ρ_o_ is change in resistivity for a change in temperature _∆T = T – To._ Its unit is per oC.

_α_ **of conductors** For conductors α is positive_._ If the

temperature of a conductor increases, the average kinetic energy of electrons in the conductor increases. This results in more frequent collisions and hence the resistivity increases. The graph of the equation (2.27) is shown in Figure 2.13.

Even though, the resistivity of conductors like metals varies linearly for wide range of temperatures, there also exists a non- linear region at very low temperatures. The resistivity approaches some finite value as the temperature approaches absolute zero as shown in Figure 2.13(b).  

Using the equation ρ = _R A l_

decreases with increase in temperature. As the temperature increases, more electrons will be liberated from their atoms (Refer unit 9 for conduction in semi conductors).

![(a) Temperature dependence of resistivity for a conductor (b) Non linear region at low temperature](2.13.png "")


Hence the current increases and therefore the resistivity decreases as shown in Figure 2.14. A semiconductor with a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity is called a thermistor.

The typical values of temperature coefficients of various materials are given in table 2.3.

![Temperature dependence of resistivity for a semiconductor](2.14.png "")


We can understand the temperature dependence of resistivity in the following way. In section 2.1.3, we have shown that

the electrical conductivity, σ τ =

_ne m_

2

. As the

resistivity is inverse of σ, it can be written as

ρ τ

\= _m_

_ne_2 (2.30)

The resistivity of materials is i) inversely proportional to the number

density (_n_) of the electrons ii) inversely proportional to the average

time between the collisions (τ). In metals, if the temperature increases, the

average time between the collision (τ) decreases and _n_ is independent of temperature. In semiconductors when temperature increases, _n_ increases and τ decreases, but increase in _n_ is dominant than decreasing τ, so that overall resistivity decreases.

The resistance of certain materials become zero below certain temperature _Tc_. This

temperature is known as critical temperature or transition temperature. The materials which exhibit this property are known as superconductors. This phenomenon was first observed by Kammerlingh Onnes in 1911. He found that mercury exhibits superconductor behaviour at 4.2 K. Since _R_ = 0, current once induced in a superconductor persists without any potential difference.

**EXAMPLE 2.13**

If the resistance of coil is 3 Ω at 200 C and _α_ = 0.004**/**0C then determine its resistance at 100 0C.

## ENERGY AND POWER IN ELECTRICAL CIRCUITS

When a battery is connected between the ends of a conductor, a current is established. The battery is supplying energy to the device which is connected in the circuit. Consider a circuit in which a battery of voltage V is connected to the resistor as shown in Figure 2.15.

Assume that a positive charge of _dQ_ moves from point _a_ to _b_ through the battery and moves from point _c_ to _d_ through the resistor and back to point _a_. When the charge  

moves from point _a_ to _b_, it gains potential energy _dU_ = _V.dQ_ and the chemical potential energy of the battery decreases by the same amount. When this charge _dQ_ passes through resistor it loses the potential energy _dU_ = _V.dQ_ due to collision with atoms in the resistor and again reaches the point _a_. This process occurs continuously till the battery is connected in the circuit. The rate at which the charge loses its electrical potential energy in the resistor can be calculated.

The electrical power P is the rate at which the electrical potential energy is delivered,

_P dU dt dt_

_V dQ dt_

\= = = ).(_V dQ_ (2.31)

Since the electric current _I dQ dt_

\= , the

equation (2.31) can be rewritten as

_P_ = _VI_ (2.32)

This expression gives the power delivered by the battery to any electrical system, where _I_ is the current passing through it and _V_ is the potential difference across it. The SI unit of electrical power is watt (1W = 1 J s–1). Commercially, the electrical bulbs used in houses come with the power and voltage rating of 5W-220V, 30W-220V, 60W-220V etc. (Figure 2.16).

![Electrical bulbs with power rating](2.16.png "")

Usually these voltage rating refers AC RMS voltages. For a given bulb, if the voltage drop across the bulb is greater than voltage rating, the bulb will fuse.

Using Ohm’s law, power delivered to the resistance R is expressed in other forms

_P_ = _IV_ = _I_ (_IR_) = _I_2_R_ (2.33)

_P_ = _IV_ = _V R_

_V V R_

\= 2

(2.34)

The electrical power produced (dissipated) by a resistor is _I_2_R_. It depends

on the square of the current. Hence, if current is doubled, the power will increase by four times. Similar explanation holds true for voltage also.

The total electrical energy used by any device is obtained by multiplying the power and duration of the time when it is ON. If the power is in watts and the time is in seconds, the energy will be in joules. In practice, electrical energy is measured in kilowatt hour (kWh). 1 kWh is known as 1 unit of electrical energy.

(1 kWh = 1000 Wh = (1000 W) (3600 s) = 3.6 × 106 J)  

The Tamilnadu Electricity Board is charging for the amount of energy you

use and not for the power. A current of 1A flowing through a potential difference of 1V produces a power of 1W.

If the voltage is kept fixed, then the power is directly proportional to current (_P_ ∝ _I_). So 60 W bulb draws twice as much as current as 30 W and it will glow brighter than 30 W bulb.




  

(b) To calculate the resistance of the

bulbs, we use the relation _P V R_

\= 2

. In both the bulbs, the voltage drop is the same. So the power is inversely proportional to the resistance or resistance is inversely proportional

to the power _R P_

∝ 1

 



  . It implies

that, the 30W has twice as much as resistance as 60 W bulb.

(c) When the bulbs are connected in series, the current passing through each bulb is the same. It is equivalent to two resistors connected in series. The bulb which has higher resistance has higher voltage drop. So 30W bulb will glow brighter than 60W bulb. So the higher power rating does not always imply more brightness and it depends whether bulbs are connected in series or parallel.

**EXAMPLE 2.16**

Two electric bulbs marked 20 W – 220 V and 100 W – 220 V are connected in series to 440 V supply. Which bulb will get fused?

## ELECTRIC CELLS AND BATTERIES

An electric cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy to produce electricity. It contains two electrodes (carbon and zinc) immersed in an electrolyte (sulphuric acid) as shown in Figure 2.17.

Several electric cells connected together form a battery. When a cell or battery is connected to a circuit, electrons flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal through the circuit. By using chemical reactions, a battery

produces potential difference across its terminals. This potential difference provides the energy to move the electrons through the circuit. Commercially available electric cells and batteries are shown in Figure 2.18.

![Electric cells and Batteries](2.18.png "")

### Electromotive force and internal resistance

A battery or cell is called a source of electromotive force (emf). The term ‘electromotive force’ is a misnomer since it does not really refer to a force but describes a potential difference in volts. The emf of a battery or cell is the voltage provided by the battery when no current flows in the external circuit. It is shown in Figure 2.19.

Electromotive force determines the amount of work a battery or cell has to do

move a certain amount of charge around the circuit. It is denoted by the symbol ε. An ideal battery has zero internal resistance and the potential difference (terminal voltage) across the battery equals to its emf. In reality, the battery is made of electrodes and electrolyte, there is resistance to the flow of charges within the battery. This resistance is called internal resistance _r_. For a real battery, the terminal voltage is not equal to the emf of the battery. A freshly prepared cell has low internal resistance and it increases with ageing.

### Determination of internal resistance

The circuit connections are made as shown in Figure 2.20.

The emf of cell ε is measured by connecting a high resistance voltmeter across it without connecting the external resistance _R_ as shown in Figure 2.20(a). Since the voltmeter draws very little current for deflection, the circuit may be considered as open. Hence the voltmeter reading gives the emf of the cell. Then, external resistance _R_ is included in the circuit and current _I_ is established in the circuit. The potential difference across

![Measuring the emf of a cell](2.19.png "")




  

R is equal to the potential difference across the cell (V) as shown in Figure 2.20(b).

The potential drop across the resistor _R_ is

_V = IR_ (2.35)

Due to internal resistance _r_ of the cell, the voltmeter reads a value _V_, which is less than the emf of cell _ε_. It is because, certain amount of voltage (_Ir_) has dropped across the internal resistance _r_.

Then _V_ = ε – _Ir_

_Ir_ = _ε_ – _V_ (2.36)

Dividing equation (2.36) by equation (2.35), we get

Since ε, _V_ and _R_ are known, internal resistance _r_ can be determined. We can also find the total current that flows in the circuit.

Due to this internal resistance, the power delivered to the circuit is not equal to power rating mentioned in the battery. For a battery of emf _ε_, with an internal resistance _r_, the power delivered to the circuit of resistance _R_ is given by

_P_ = _Iε_ = _I_ (_V_ + _Ir_) (from equation 2.36)

Here _V_ is the voltage drop across the resistance _R_ and it is equal to _IR_.

Therefore, _P_ = _I_ (_IR_ +_Ir_)

_P_ = _I_2 _R_ + _I_2 _r_ (2.38)

Here _I_ 2_r_ is the power delivered to the internal resistance and _I_ 2_R_ is the power delivered to the electrical device (here it is the resistance _R_). For a good battery, the internal resistance _r_ is very small, then _I_ 2_r_ << _I_ 2_R_ and almost entire power is delivered to the external resistance.

**EXAMPLE 2.17**

A battery has an emf of 12 V and connected to a resistor of 3 Ω. The current in the circuit is 3.93 A. Calculate (a) terminal voltage and the internal resistance of the battery (b) power delivered by the battery and power delivered to the resistor

**_Solution_**

The given values _I_ = 3.93 A, _ε_ = 12 V, _R_ = 3 Ω

(a) The terminal voltage of the battery is equal to voltage drop across the resistor

_V_ = _IR_ = 3.93 × 3 = 11.79 V

(b) The power delivered by the battery _P_ = _Iε_ = 3.93 × 12 = 47.1 W

The power delivered to the resistor = _I_ 2_R_ = 46.3 W

The remaining power _P_ = (47.1 – 46.3) = 0.8 W is delivered to the internal resistance and cannot be used to do useful work. (It is equal to _I_ 2_r_).

### Cells in series

Several cells can be connected to form a battery. In series connection, the negative terminal of one cell is connected to the positive terminal of the second cell, the negative terminal of second cell is connected to the positive terminal of the third cell and so on. The free positive terminal of the first cell and the free negative terminal of the last cell become the terminals of the battery.

Suppose _n_ cells, each of emf ε volts and internal resistance _r_ ohms are connected in series with an external resistance _R_ as shown in Figure 2.21

Case (b) If _r_\>>_R_, _I n nr r_

\= ≈ ε ε (2.41)

It is the current due to a single cell. That is, current due to the whole battery is the same as that due to a single cell and hence there is no advantage in connecting several cells.

Thus series connection of cells is advantageous only when the effective internal resistance of the cells is negligibly small compared with _R_.

### Cells in parallel

In parallel connection all the positive terminals of the cells are connected to one point and all the negative terminals to a second point. These two points form the positive and negative terminals of the battery.

Let _n_ cells be connected in parallel between the points A and B and a resistance _R_ is connected between the points A and B as shown in Figure 2.22. Let _ε_ be the emf and _r_ the internal resistance of each cell.

The above equation implies that current due to the whole battery is the same as that due to a single cell. Hence it is advantageous to connect cells in parallel when the external resistance is very small compared to the internal resistance of the cells.

When the car engine is started with headlights turned on, they sometimes

become dim. This is due to the internal resistance of the car battery.

## KIRCHHOFF’S RULES

Ohm’s law is useful only for simple circuits. For more complex circuits, Kirchhoff ’s rules can be used to find current and voltage. There are two generalized rules: i) Kirchhoff ’s current rule ii) Kirchhoff ’s voltage rule.

### Kirchhoff’s first rule (Current rule or Junction rule)

**It states that the algebraic sum of the currents at any junction of a circuit is zero**. It is a statement of law of conservation of electric charge. The charges that enter a given junction in a circuit must leave that junction since charge cannot build up or disappear at a junction. By convention, current entering the junction is taken as positive and current leaving the junction is taken as negative.

Applying this law to the junction A in Figure 2.23

_I1 + I2 – I3 – I4 – I5_ = 0 (or)

_I1 + I2 = I3 + I4 + I5_

**EXAMPLE 2.20**

For the given circuit find the value of _I_.

_I_

0.4A

P 0.6A 0.5A

0.7A

0.2A

**_Solution_**

Applying Kirchhoff ’s rule to the point P in the circuit,

The arrows pointing towards P are positive and away from P are negative. Therefore, 0.2A – 0.4A + 0.6A – 0.5A + 0.7A – _I_ = 0 1.5A – 0.9A – _I_ = 0 0.6A – _I_ = 0 _I_ = 0.6 A  

### Kirchhoff’s Second rule (Voltage rule or Loop rule)

**It states that in a closed circuit the algebraic sum of the products of the current and resistance of each part of the circuit is equal to the total emf included in the circuit**. This rule follows from the law of conservation of energy for an isolated system (The energy supplied by the emf sources is equal to the sum of the energy delivered to all resistors). The product of current and resistance is taken as positive when the direction of the current is followed. Suppose if the direction of current is opposite to the direction of the loop, then product of current and voltage across the resistor is negative. It is shown in Figure 2.24 (a) and (b). The emf is considered positive when proceeding from the negative to the positive terminal of the cell. It is shown in Figure 2.24 (c) and (d).

Kirchhoff voltage rule has to be applied only when all currents in the circuit reach a steady state condition (the current in various branches are constant).

**EXAMPLE 2.21**

The following figure shows a complex network of conductors which can be divided into two closed loops like EACE and ABCA. Apply Kirchhoff ’s voltage rule (KVR),

We can denote the current that flows from 9V battery as _I1_ and it splits up into _I2_ and (_I1_ – _I2_) at the junction E according Kirchhoff ’s current rule (KCR).

Now consider the loop EFCBE and apply KVR, we get

1_I2_ + 3_I1_ + 2_I1_ = 9

5_I1_ + _I2_ = 9 (1)

Applying KVR to the loop EADFE, we get

3 (_I1_ – _I2_ ) – 1_I2_ = 6

3_I1_ – 4_I2_ = 6 (2)

Solving equation (1) and (2), we get

_I1_ = 1.83 A and _I2_ = –0.13 A

It implies that the current in the 1 ohm resistor flows from F to E.

### Wheatstone’s bridge

An important application of Kirchhoff ’s rules is the Wheatstone’s bridge. It is used to compare resistances and in determining the unknown resistance in electrical network. The bridge consists of four resistances _P, Q, R_ and _S_ connected as shown in Figure 2.25. _A_ galvanometer _G_ is connected between the points _B_ and _D_. The battery is connected between the points _A_ and _C_. The current

through the galvanometer is _IG_ and its resistance is _G_.

Applying Kirchhoff ’s current rule to junction _B_ and _D_ respectively.

_I_1 – _I_G – _I_3 = 0 (2.45)

_I_2 + _I_G – _I_4 = 0 (2.46)

Applying Kirchhoff ’s voltage rule to loop _ABDA_,

_I_1_P_ + _I_G_G_ – _I_2_R_ = 0 (2.47)

Applying Kirchhoff ’s voltage rule to loop _ABCDA_,

_I_1_P_ + _I_3_Q_ – _I_4_S_ – _I_2_R_ = 0 (2.48)

When the points _B_ and _D_ are at the same potential, the bridge is said to be balanced. As there is no potential difference between _B_ and _D_, no current flows through galvanometer (_IG_ = 0). Substituting _I_G = 0 in equation (2.45), (2.46) and (2.47), we get

_I_1= _I_3 (2.49)

Dividing equation (2.52) by equation (2.51), we get

This is the condition for bridge balance. Only under this condition, galvanometer shows null deflection. Suppose we know the values of two adjacent resistances, the other two resistances can be compared. If three of the resistances are known, the value of unknown resistance (fourth one) can be determined.

A galvanometer is an instrument used for detecting and measuring even very small electric currents. It is extensively useful to compare the potential difference between various parts of the circuit.

**EXAMPLE 2.23**

In a Wheatstone’s bridge _P_ = 100 Ω, _Q_ = 1000 Ω and _R_ = 40 Ω. If the galvanometer shows zero deflection, determine the value of _S_.

### Meter bridge

The meter bridge is another form of Wheatstone’s bridge. It consists of a uniform wire of manganin AB of one meter length. This wire is stretched along a metre scale on a wooden board between two copper strips C and D. Between these two copper strips another copper strip E is mounted to enclose two gaps G1 and G2 as shown in Figure 2.26.

An unknown resistance _P_ is connected in G1 and a standard resistance _Q_ is connected in G2. A jockey (conducting wire-contact maker) is connected to the terminal E on the central copper strip through a galvanometer (G) and a high resistance (HR). The exact position of jockey on the wire can be read on the scale. A Lechlanche cell and a key (K) are connected between the ends of the bridge wire.

The bridge wire is soldered at the ends of the copper strips. Due to imperfect contact, some resistance might be introduced at the contact. These are called end resistances. This error can be eliminated, if another set of readings is taken with _P_ and _Q_ interchanged and the average value of _P_ is found.

To find the specific resistance of the material of the wire in the coil P, the radius _a_ and length _l_ of the wire are measured. The specific resistance or resistivity _ρ_ can be calculated using the relation.

Resistance = ρ _l A_

By rearranging the above equation, we get

ρ= ×Resistance _A l_

If _P_ is the unknown resistance equation (2.57) becomes,

### Potentiometer

Potentiometer is used for the accurate measurement of potential differences, current and resistances. It consists of ten meter long uniform wire of manganin or constantan stretched in parallel rows each of 1 meter length, on a wooden board. The two free ends A and B are brought to the same side and fixed to copper strips with binding screws. A meter scale is fixed parallel to the wire. A jockey is provided for making contact.

The principle of the potentiometer is illustrated in Figure 2.27. A steady current is maintained across the wire CD by a battery _Bt_.

The battery, key and the potentiometer wire connected in series form the primary circuit. The positive terminal of a primary cell of emf ε is connected to the point C and negative terminal is connected to the jockey through a galvanometer G and a high resistance HR. This forms the secondary circuit.

Let the contact be made at any point J on the wire by jockey. If the potential difference across CJ is equal to the emf of the cell ε, then no current will flow through the galvanometer and it will show zero deflection. CJ is the balancing length _l_. The potential difference across CJ is equal to _Irl_ where _I_ is the current flowing through the wire and _r_ is the resistance per unit length of the wire.

Hence ε = _Irl_ (2.58)

Since _I_ and _r_ are constants, ε ∝ _l_. The emf of the cell is directly proportional to the balancing length.

### Comparison of emf of two cells with a potentiometer

To compare the emf of two cells, the circuit connections are made as shown in Figure 2.28. Potentiometer wire CD is connected to a battery _Bt_ and a key K in  

series. This is the primary circuit. The end C of the wire is connected to the terminal M of a DPDT (Double Pole Double Throw) switch and the other terminal N is connected to a jockey through a galvanometer G and a high resistance HR. The cells whose emf ε1 and ε2 to be compared are connected to the terminals M1,N1 and M2,N2 of the DPDT switch. The positive terminals of _Bt_, ε1 and ε2 should be connected to the same end C.

The DPDT switch is pressed towards M1, N1 so that cell ε1 is included in the secondary circuit and the balancing length _l_1 is found by adjusting the jockey for zero deflection. Then the second cell ε2 is included in the circuit and the balancing length _l_2 is determined. Let _r_ be the resistance per unit length of the potentiometer wire and _I_ be the current flowing through the wire.

we have ε1 = _Irl_1 (2.59)

By including a rheostat (Rh) in the primary circuit, the experiment can be repeated several times by changing the current flowing through it.

### Measurement of internal resistance of a cell by potentiometer

To measure the internal resistance of a cell, the circuit connections are made as shown in Figure 2.29. The end C of the potentiometer wire is connected to the positive terminal of the battery Bt and the negative terminal of the battery is connected to the end D through a key K1. This forms the primary circuit.

The positive terminal of the cell of emf ε whose internal resistance is to be determined is also connected to the end C of the wire. The negative terminal of the cell ε is connected to a jockey through a galvanometer and a high resistance. A resistance box R and key K2 are connected across the cell ε. With K2 open, the balancing point J is obtained and the balancing length CJ = _l_1 is measured. Since the cell is in open circuit, its emf is

ε ∝ _l_1 (2.62)  

A suitable resistance (say, 10 Ω) is included in the resistance box and key K2 is closed. Let r be the internal resistance of the cell. The current passing through the cell and the resistance R is given by

_I R r_

\= + ε

The potential difference across R is

_V R R r_

\= + ε

When this potential difference is balanced on the potentiometer wire, let _l_2 be the balancing length.

Then ε_R R r_

Substituting the values of the _R_, _l_1 and _l_2, the internal resistance of the cell is determined. The experiment can be repeated for different values of _R_. It is found that the internal resistance of the cell is not constant but increases with increase of external resistance connected across its terminals.

## HEATING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT

**When current flows through a resistor, some of the electrical energy delivered to the resistor is converted into heat energy and it is dissipated. This heating effect of**




  

(a)

**current is known as Joule’s heating effect.** Just as current produces thermal energy, thermal energy may also be suitably used to produce an electromotive force. This is known as thermoelectric effect.

### Joule’s law

If a current _I_ flows through a conductor kept across a potential difference _V_ for a time _t_, the work done or the electric potential energy spent is

_W_ = _VIt_ (2.66)

In the absence of any other external effect, this energy is spent in heating the conductor. The amount of heat(_H_) produced is

_H_ = _VIt_ (2.67)

For a resistance _R_,

_H_ = _I_2_Rt_ (2.68)

This relation was experimentally verified by Joule and is known as Joule’s law of heating. It states that **the heat developed in an electrical circuit due to the flow of current varies directly as (i) the square of the current (ii) the resistance of the circuit and (iii) the time of flow.**

**EXAMPLE 2.27**

Find the heat energy produced in a resistance of 10 Ω when 5 A current flows through it for 5 minutes.

**_Solution_** _R_ = 10 Ω, _I_ = 5 A, _t_ = 5 minutes = 5 × 60 s _H_ = _I_ 2_Rt_ \= 52 × 10 × 5 × 60 = 25 × 10 × 300 = 25 × 3000 = 75000 J (or) 75 kJ  

### Application of Joule’s heating effect

**1\. Electric heaters** Electric iron, electric heater, electric

toaster shown in Figure 2.30 are some of the home appliances that utilize the heating effect of current. In these appliances, the heating elements are made of nichrome, an alloy of nickel and chromium. Nichrome has a high specific resistance and can be heated to very high temperatures without oxidation.

**EXAMPLE 2.28**

An electric heater of resistance 10 Ω connected to 220 V power supply is immersed in the water of 1 kg. How long the electrical heater has to be switched on to increase its temperature from 30°C to 60°C. (Specific heat capacity of water is s = 4200 J kg–1 K–1)




  

**_Solution_**

According to Joule’s heating law _H = I 2Rt_

The current passed through the electrical

heater = 220 10

22V A Ω

\=

Heat produced in one second by the electrical heater _H = I2R_

Heat produced in one second _H_ = (22)2 × 10 = 4840 J = 4.84 k J. In fact the power rating of this electrical heater is 4.84 k W.

The amount of heat energy to increase the temperature of 1kg water from 30°C to 60°C is

_Q = ms ∆T_ (Refer XI physics vol 2, unit 8)

Here _m_ = 1 kg, _s_ = 4200 J kg–1 K–1, ∆_T_ = 30 K,

so _Q_ = 1 × 4200 × 30 = 126 kJ

**2\. Electric fuses** Fuses as shown in Figure 2.31, are

connected in series in a circuit to protect the electric devices from the heat developed by the passage of excessive current. It is a short length of a wire made of a low melting point material. It melts and breaks the circuit if current exceeds a certain value. An alloy of lead - tin is used for fuses when current rating is below 15 A and when current rating is above 15 A, copper fuse wires are used.

The only disadvantage with the above fuses is that once fuse wire is burnt due to excessive current, they need to be replaced. Nowadays in houses, circuit breakers

Contacts

Base

Fuse  

(trippers) are also used instead of fuses. Whenever there is an excessive current produced due to faulty wire connection, the circuit breaker switch opens. After repairing the faulty connection, we can close the circuit breaker switch. It is shown in the Figure 2.32.

![circuit breakers](2.32.png "")

**3\. Electric furnace** Furnaces as shown in Figure 2.33 are

used to manufacture a large number of technologically important materials such as steel, silicon carbide, quartz, gallium arsenide, etc. To produce temperatures up to 1500°C, molybdenum-nichrome wire wound on a silica tube is used. Carbon arc furnaces produce temperatures up to 3000°C.

In incandescent electric lamps only about 5% of electrical energy is converted into light and the rest is wasted as heat. Electric discharge lamps, electric welding and electric arc also utilize the heating effect of current as shown in Figure 2.34.

## THERMOELECTRIC EFFECT

**Conversion of temperature differences into electrical voltage and vice versa is known as thermoelectric effect.** A thermoelectric device generates voltage when there is a temperature difference on each side. If a voltage is applied, it generates a temperature difference.  

### Seebeck effect

**Seebeck discovered that in a closed circuit consisting of two dissimilar metals, when the junctions are maintained at different temperatures an emf (potential difference) is developed. The current that flows due to the emf developed is called thermoelectric current. The two dissimilar metals connected to form two junctions is known as thermocouple** (Figure 2.35).

If the hot and cold junctions are interchanged, the direction of current also reverses. Hence the effect is reversible.

The magnitude of the emf developed in a thermocouple depends on (i) the nature of the metals forming the couple and (ii) the temperature difference between the junctions.

**Applications of Seebeck effect** 1\. Seebeck effect is used in

thermoelectric generators (Seebeck generators).These thermoelectric generators are used in power plants to convert waste heat into electricity.




  

2\. This effect is utilized in automobiles as automotive thermoelectric generators for increasing fuel efficiency.

3\. Seebeck effect is used in thermocouples and thermopiles to measure the temperature difference between the two objects.

### Peltier effect

In 1834, Peltier discovered that **when an electric current is passed through a circuit of a thermocouple, heat is evolved at one junction and** **absorbed at the other junction. This is known as Peltier effect.**

In the Cu-Fe thermocouple the junctions A and B are maintained at the same temperature. Let a current from a battery flow through the thermocouple (Figure 2.36 (a)). At the junction A, where the current flows from Cu to Fe, heat is absorbed and the junction A becomes cold. At the junction B, where the current flows from Fe to Cu heat is liberated and it becomes hot. When the direction of current is reversed, junction A  

gets heated and junction B gets cooled as shown in the Figure 2.36(b). Hence Peltier effect is reversible.

### Thomson effect

Thomson showed that **if two points in a conductor are at different temperatures, the density of electrons at these points will differ and as a result the potential difference is created between these points. Thomson effect is also reversible.**

If current is passed through a copper bar AB which is heated at the middle point C, the point C will be at higher potential. This indicates that the heat is absorbed along AC and evolved along CB of the conductor as shown in Figure 2.37(a). Thus heat is transferred due to the current flow in the direction of the current. It is called positive Thomson effect. Similar effect is observed in metals like silver, zinc, and cadmium.

When the copper bar is replaced by an iron bar, heat is evolved along CA and absorbed along BC. Thus heat is transferred due to the current flow in the direction opposite to the direction of current. It is called negative Thomson effect as shown in the Figure 2.37(b). Similar effect is observed in metals like platinum, nickel, cobalt, and mercury.
