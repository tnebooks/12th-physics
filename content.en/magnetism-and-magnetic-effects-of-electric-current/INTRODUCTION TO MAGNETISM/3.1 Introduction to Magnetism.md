## INTRODUCTION TO MAGNETISM

Magnets! No doubt, their behaviour will attract everyone. The world enjoys their benefits, to lead a modern luxurious life. The study of magnets fascinated scientists around our globe for many centuries and even now, door for research on magnets is still open (Figure 3.1).

Many birds and animals have magnetic sense in their eyes using Earth’s magnetic field for navigation.

Magnetism exists everywhere from tiny
particles like electrons to the entire universe. Historically the word ‘magnetism’ was
derived from iron ore magnetite (Fe3
O4).In olden days, magnets were used as magnetic compass for navigation, magnetic therapy for treatment and also used in magic shows.

In modern days, many things we use in
our daily life contain magnets (Figure 3.2). Motors, cycle dynamo, loudspeakers, magnetic tapes used in audio and video recording, mobile phones, head phones, CD, pen-drive, hard disc of laptop, refrigerator
door, generator are a few examples.

Earlier, both electricity and magnetism were thought to be two independent branches in physics. In 1820, H.C. Oersted observed the deflection of magnetic compass needle kept near a current carrying wire. This unified the two different branches, electricity and magnetism as a single subjec ‘electromagnetism’ in physics.

In this unit, basics of magnets and
their properties are given. Later how a current carrying conductor (here only steady current, not time-varying current is considered) behaves like a magnet is presented.
