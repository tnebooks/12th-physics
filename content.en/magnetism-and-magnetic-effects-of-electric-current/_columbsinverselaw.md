## COULOMB’S INVERSE SQUARE LAW OF MAGNETISM

Consider two bar magnets A and B as shown in Figure 3.11. When the north pole of magnet A and the north pole of magnet B or the south pole of magnet A and the south pole of magnet B are brought closer, they repel each other.

On the other hand, when the north pole of magnet A and the south pole of magnet B or the south pole of magnet A and the north pole of magnet B are brought closer, their poles attract each other.

This looks similar to Coulomb’s law for static charges studied in Unit I (opposite charges attract and like charges repel each other). So analogous to Coulomb’s law in electrostatics, we can state Coulomb’s law for magnetism (Figure 3.12) as follows:

**The force of attraction or repulsion between two magnetic poles is directly proportional to the product of their pole strengths and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.**

Mathematically, we can write



_F q q_

_r rm mA B_∝ 2 

where _qmA_ and _qmB_

are pole strengths of two poles and _r_ is the distance between two magnetic poles.

space is _k_ \= ≈ − −µ π 

**EXAMPLE 3.5 Coulomb’s law – force between two magnetic poles**

The repulsive force between two magnetic poles in air is 9 × 10–3 N. If the two poles are equal in strength and are separated by a distance of 10 cm, calculate the pole strength of each pole.

**_Solution_:** The magnitude of the force between two poles is given by

_F k q q_

_r m mA B_\= 2

Given : _F_ = 9 × 10–3 N, _r_ = 10 cm = 10 × 10–2 m

### Magnetic field at a point along the equatorial line due to a magnetic dipole (bar magnet)

Consider a bar magnet NS as shown in Figure 3.14. Let N be the north pole and S be the south pole of the bar magnet, each with pole strength _qm_ and separated by a distance of 2_l_. The magnetic field at a point C (lies along the equatorial line) at a distance _r_ from the geometrical centre O of the bar magnet can be computed by keeping unit north pole (_qmC_ = 1 A m) at C.

A short bar magnet has a magnetic moment of 0.5 J T –1. Calculate magnitude and direction of the magnetic field produced by the bar magnet which is kept at a distance of 0.1 m from the centre of the bar magnet along (a) axial line of the bar magnet and (b) normal bisector of the bar magnet.
