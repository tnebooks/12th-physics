## INTRODUCTION TO MAGNETISM

**Figure 3.1:** Magnetic levitation

Magnets! No doubt, their behaviour will attract everyone. The world enjoys their benefits, to lead a modern luxurious life. The study of magnets fascinated scientists around our globe for many centuries and even now, door for research on magnets is still open (Figure 3.1).

Many birds and animals have magnetic sense in their eyes using Earth’s

magnetic field for navigation.

Magnetic sensing in eyes - for Zebra finch bird, due to protein cryptochromes Cry4 present in retina; the bird uses Earth's magnetic field for navigation  

Magnetism exists everywhere from tiny particles like electrons to the entire universe. Historically the word ‘magnetism’ was derived from iron ore magnetite (Fe3O4). In olden days, magnets were used as magnetic compass for navigation, magnetic therapy for treatment and also used in magic shows.

In modern days, many things we use in our daily life contain magnets (Figure 3.2). Motors, cycle dynamo, loudspeakers, magnetic tapes used in audio and video recording, mobile phones, head phones, CD, pen-drive, hard disc of laptop, refrigerator door, generator are a few examples.

Earlier, both electricity and magnetism were thought to be two independent branches in physics. In 1820, H.C. Oersted observed the deflection of magnetic compass needle kept near a current carrying wire. This unified the two different branches, electricity and magnetism as a single subject ‘electromagnetism’ in physics.

In this unit, basics of magnets and their properties are given. Later, how a current carrying conductor (here only steady current, not time-varying current is considered) behaves like a magnet is presented.

From the activities performed in lower classes, you might have noticed that the needle in a magnetic compass or freely suspended magnet comes to rest in a position which is approximately along the geographical north- south direction of the Earth.

William Gilbert in 1600 proposed that Earth itself behaves like a gigantic

powerful bar magnet. But this theory is not successful because the temperature inside the Earth is very high and so it will not be possible for a magnet to retain its magnetism.

Gover suggested that the Earth’s magnetic field is due to hot rays coming out from the Sun. These rays will heat up the air near equatorial region. Once air becomes hotter, it rises above and will move towards northern and southern hemispheres and get electrified. This may be responsible to magnetize the ferromagnetic materials near the Earth’s surface. Till date, so many theories have been proposed. But none of the theorium completely explains the cause for the Earth’s magnetism.  

The north pole of magnetic compass needle is attracted towards the magnetic south pole of the Earth which is near the geographic north pole (Figure 3.3). Similarly, the south pole of magnetic compass needle is attracted towards the magnetic north-pole of the Earth which is near the geographic south pole. **The branch of physics which deals with the Earth’s magnetic field is called Geomagnetism or Terrestrial magnetism.**

There are three quantities required to specify the magnetic field of the Earth on its surface, which are often called as the elements of the Earth’s magnetic field. They are

(a) magnetic declination (_D_) (b) magnetic dip or inclination (_I_) (c) the horizontal component of the

Earth’s magnetic field (_BH_)

Day and night occur because Earth spins about an axis called geographic axis. A vertical plane passing through the geographic axis is called geographic meridian and a great circle perpendicular to Earth’s geographic axis is called geographic equator.

The straight line which connects magnetic poles of Earth is known as magnetic axis.

A vertical plane passing through magnetic axis is called magnetic meridian and a great circle perpendicular to Earth’s magnetic axis is called magnetic equator.

When a magnetic needle is freely suspended, the alignment of the magnet does not exactly lie along the geographic meridian as shown in Figure 3.4. **The angle between magnetic meridian at a point and geographical meridian is called the _declination or magnetic declination_** (_D_). At higher latitudes, the declination is greater whereas near the equator, the declination is smaller. In India, declination angle is very small and for Chennai, magnetic declination angle is –1o 16ʹ (which is negative (west)).

**The angle subtended by the Earth’s total magnetic field**



_B_ **with the horizontal direction in the magnetic meridian is called dip or magnetic inclination** (_I_) **at that point** (Figure 3.5). For Chennai, inclination angle is 14o 28ʹ. **The component of Earth’s magnetic field along the horizontal direction in the magnetic meridian is called horizontal component of Earth’s magnetic field, denoted by _BH_.**

Let _BE_ be the net Earth’s magnetic field at any point on the surface of the Earth. _BE_ can be resolved into two perpendicular components.

Horizontal component _BH_ = _BE_ cos _I_ (3.1)

Vertical component _BV_ = _BE_ sin _I_ (3.2)

Dividing equation (3.2) and (3.1), we get

**(i) At magnetic equator** The Earth’s magnetic field is parallel to the

surface of the Earth (i.e., horizontal) which implies that the needle of magnetic compass rests horizontally at an angle of dip, _I_ = 0o.

_BH_ = _BE_

_BV_ = 0

This implies that the horizontal component is maximum and vertical component is zero at the equator.

**(ii) At magnetic poles** The Earth’s magnetic field is

perpendicular to the surface of the Earth (i.e., vertical) which implies that the needle of magnetic compass rests vertically at an angle of dip, _I_ = 90o. Hence,

_BH_ = 0 _BV_ = _BE_

This implies that the vertical component is maximum at poles and horizontal component is zero at poles.

**EXAMPLE 3.1**

The horizontal component and vertical component of Earth’s magnetic field at a place are 0.15 G and 0.26 G respectively. Calculate the angle of dip and resultant magnetic field. (G-gauss, cgs unit for magnetic field 1G = 10–4 T) **_Solution:_**

These particles emit light due to collision and variations in colour are due to the type of the gas particles that take part in the collisions. A pale yellowish – green colour is produced when the ionized oxygen takes part in the collision and a blue or purplish – red aurora is produced due to ionized nitrogen molecules.

### Basic properties of magnets

Some basic terminologies and properties used in describing bar magnet.

**(a) Magnetic dipole moment**

Consider a bar magnet as shown in Figure 3.6. Let _qm_ be the pole strength of the magnetic pole and let _l_ be the distance between the geometrical centre of bar magnet O and one end of the pole. **The magnetic dipole moment is defined as the product of its pole strength and magnetic length**. It is a vector quantity, denoted by _pm_.

where 

_d_ is the vector drawn from south pole to north pole and its magnitude

_d l_\= 2 .

The magnitude of magnetic dipole moment is _p q lm m_\= 2

The SI unit of magnetic moment is A m2. The direction of magnetic moment is from south pole to north pole.

**(b) Magnetic field**

Magnetic field is the region or space around every magnet within which its influence will be felt by keeping another magnet in that region. **The magnetic field**



**_B_ at a point is defined as a force experienced by the bar magnet of unit pole strength**.  

_B q_

_F m_

  =

Its unit is N A–1 m–1. **(c) Types of magnets**

Magnets are classified into natural magnets and artificial magnets. For example, iron, cobalt, nickel, etc. are natural magnets. Strengths of natural magnets are very weak and the shapes of the magnet are irregular. Artificial magnets are made in order to have desired shape and strength. If the magnet is in the form of rectangular shape or cylindrical shape, then it is known as bar magnet. **Properties of magnet**

The following are the properties of bar magnet (Figure 3.7), 1. A freely suspended bar magnet will always

point along the north-south direction. 2. A magnet attracts or repels another

magnet or magnetic substances towards itself. The attractive or repulsive force is maximum near the end of the bar magnet. When a bar magnet is dipped into iron filling, they cling to the ends of the magnet.

3\. When a magnet is broken into pieces, each piece behaves like a magnet with poles at its ends.

4\. Two poles of a magnet have pole strength equal to one another.

5\. The length of the bar magnet is called geometrical length and the length between two magnetic poles in a bar magnet is called magnetic length. Magnetic length is always slightly smaller than geometrical length. The ratio of magnetic length and geometrical length is 5

(i) Pole strength is a scalar quantity with dimension \[MoLToA\]. Its SI unit is N T–1

(newton per tesla) or A m (ampere-metre). (ii) Like positive and negative charges in electrostatics, north pole of a magnet experiences a force in the direction of magnetic field while south pole of a magnet experiences force opposite to the magnetic field. (iii) Pole strength depends on the nature of materials of the magnet, area of cross- section and the state of magnetization. (iv) If a magnet is cut into two equal halves along the length then pole strength is reduced to half. (v) If a magnet is cut into two equal halves perpendicular to the length, then pole strength remains same. (vi) If a magnet is cut into two pieces, we will not get separate north and south poles. Instead, we get two magnets. In other words, isolated monopole does not exist in nature.

**Magnetic field lines**

1\. Magnetic field lines are continuous closed curves. The direction of magnetic field lines is from North pole to South pole outside the magnet and from South pole to North pole inside the magnet.

2\. The direction of magnetic field at any point on the curve is known by drawing tangent to the magnetic field lines at that point.

3\. Magnetic field lines never intersect each other. Otherwise, the magnetic compass needle would point towards two different directions, which is not possible.

4\. The degree of closeness of the field lines determines the relative strength of the magnetic field. The magnetic field is strong where magnetic field lines crowd and weak where magnetic field lines are well separated.

**(d) Magnetic flux The number of magnetic field lines**

**crossing any area normally is defined as magnetic flux** _ΦB_ **through the area.** Mathematically, the magnetic flux through a surface of area





**Special cases**

(a) When 

_B_ is normal to the surface i.e., _θ_ \= 0o, the magnetic flux is _ΦB_ = _BA_ (maximum).

(b) When 

_B_ is parallel to the surface i.e., _θ_ = 90o, the magnetic flux is _ΦB_ = 0.

Suppose the magnetic field is not uniform over the surface, the equation (3.6) can be written as

Φ_B B A_\= ∫  

.d

Magnetic flux is a scalar quantity. The SI unit for magnetic flux is weber, which is denoted by symbol Wb. Dimensional formula for magnetic flux is ML T A2 2 1− −  . The CGS unit of magnetic flux is maxwell.

1 weber = 108 maxwell

**The magnetic flux density is defined as the number of magnetic field lines crossing per unit area kept normal to the direction of lines of force.** Its unit is Wb m–2 or tesla (T).

**(e) Uniform magnetic field and Non- uniform magnetic field**

**Uniform magnetic field** Magnetic field is said to be uniform if it

has same magnitude and direction at all the

**Figure 3.9 Uniform magnetic field**

|------|------|

  

points in a given region. Example, locally Earth’s magnetic field is uniform.

The magnetic field of Earth has same value over the entire area of your school!

**Non-uniform magnetic field** Magnetic field is said to be non-uniform

if the magnitude or direction or both vary at different points in a region. Example: magnetic field of a bar magnet

**EXAMPLE 3.4**

Calculate the magnetic flux coming out from closed surface containing magnetic dipole (say, a bar magnet) as shown in figure.

**_Solution_**

The total flux emanating from the closed surface S enclosing the dipole is zero. So,

Here the integral is taken over closed surface. Since no isolated magnetic pole (called magnetic monopole) exists, this integral is always zero,

  _B A_.d =∫ 0

This is similar to Gauss’s law in electrostatics.

## COULOMB’S INVERSE SQUARE LAW OF MAGNETISM

Consider two bar magnets A and B as shown in Figure 3.11. When the north pole of magnet A and the north pole of magnet B or the south pole of magnet A and the south pole of magnet B are brought closer, they repel each other.

On the other hand, when the north pole of magnet A and the south pole of magnet B or the south pole of magnet A and the north pole of magnet B are brought closer, their poles attract each other.

This looks similar to Coulomb’s law for static charges studied in Unit I (opposite charges attract and like charges repel each other). So analogous to Coulomb’s law in electrostatics, we can state Coulomb’s law for magnetism (Figure 3.12) as follows:

### Magnetic field at a point along the equatorial line due to a magnetic dipole (bar magnet)

Consider a bar magnet NS as shown in Figure 3.14. Let N be the north pole and S be the south pole of the bar magnet, each with pole strength _qm_ and separated by a distance of 2_l_. The magnetic field at a point C (lies along the equatorial line) at a distance _r_ from the geometrical centre O of the bar magnet can be computed by keeping unit north pole (_qmC_ = 1 A m) at C.

## TORQUE ACTING ON A BAR MAGNET IN UNIFORM MAGNETIC FIELD

Consider a magnet of length 2_l_ and pole strength _qm_ kept in a uniform magnetic field



_B_ as shown in Figure 3.16. Each pole experiences a force of magnitude _qmB_ but acting in opposite directions. Therefore, the net force exerted on the magnet is zero and hence, there is no translatory motion.

From the above two results, We infer that the potential energy of the bar magnet is minimum when it is aligned along the external magnetic field and maximum when the bar magnet is aligned anti-parallel to external magnetic field.

**EXAMPLE 3.7**

Consider a magnetic dipole which on switching ON external magnetic field orient only in two possible ways i.e., one along the direction of the magnetic field (parallel to the field) and another anti-parallel to magnetic field. Compute the energy for the possible orientation.

**_Solution_**

Let _pm_ be the dipole and before switching ON the external magnetic field, there is no orientation. Therefore, the energy U = 0.

As soon as external magnetic field is switched ON, the magnetic dipole orient parallel (θ = 0o) to the magnetic field with energy,

## MAGNETIC PROPERTIES

All materials are not magnetic in nature. Further, all the magnetic materials will not behave identically. So, in order to differentiate one magnetic material from another, some basic parameters are used. They are:

**(a) Magnetising field The magnetic field which is used to**

**magnetize a sample or specimen is called the magnetising field.** Magnetising field is a vector quantity and is denoted by



_H_ and its unit is A m–1.

**(b) Magnetic permeability The magnetic permeability is the**

**measure of ability of the material to allow the passage of magnetic field lines through it or measure of the capacity of the substance to take magnetisation or the degree of penetration of magnetic field through the substance.**

In free space, the permeability (or absolute permeability) is denoted by µ0 and for any other medium it is denoted by µ.**The relative permeability** µ**r** **is defined as the ratio between absolute permeability of the medium to the permeability of free space.**

  _r_  

(3.29)

Relative permeability is a dimensionless number and has no units. For free space (air or vacuum), the relative permeability is unity i.e., _µr_ = 1.  

**(c) Intensity of magnetisation**

Any bulk material (any object of finite size) contains a large number of atoms. Each atom consists of electrons which undergo orbital motion. Due to orbital motion, electron has magnetic moment which is a vector quantity. In general, these magnetic moments orient randomly, therefore, the net magnetic moment is zero per unit volume of the material.

When such a material is kept in an external magnetic field, atomic dipoles are induced and hence, they will try to align partially or fully along the direction of external field. **The net magnetic moment per unit volume of the material** is known **as intensity of magnetisation.** It is a vector quantity. Mathematically,

_M p V_

_m_  

\= = Magneticmoment

The SI unit of intensity of magnetisation is ampere metre–1. For a bar magnet of pole strength _qm_, length 2_l_ and area of cross-section _A_, the magnetic moment of the bar magnet is

This means, **for a bar magnet the intensity of magnetisation can be defined as the pole strength per unit area (face area).**

_H_ , the substance gets magnetised. **The magnetic induction (total magnetic field) inside the specimen**

**(e) Magnetic susceptibility**

When a substance is kept in a magnetising field



_H_ , magnetic susceptibility gives information about how a material responds to the external (applied) magnetic field. In other words, the magnetic susceptibility measures how easily and how strongly a material can be magnetised. It is defined **as the ratio of the intensity of magnetisation** 

**_M_**( ) **induced in the material to the magnetising field**

It is a dimensionless quantity. Magnetic susceptibility for some of the isotropic substances is given in Table 3.1.

## CLASSIFICATION OF MAGNETIC MATERIALS

The magnetic materials are generally classified into three types based on their behaviour in a magnetising field. They are diamagnetic, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic materials.

**(a) Diamagnetic materials** The orbital motion of electrons around

the nucleus produces a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the orbit. Thus each electron orbit has finite orbital magnetic dipole moment. Since the orbital planes of the other electrons are oriented in random manner, the vector sum of magnetic moments is zero and there is no resultant magnetic moment for each atom.

In the presence of a uniform external magnetic field, some electrons are speeded up and some are slowed down. The electrons whose moments were anti-parallel are speeded up according to Lenz’s law and this produces an induced magnetic moment in a direction opposite to the field. The induced moment disappears as soon as the external field is removed.

When placed in a non-uniform magnetic field, the interaction between induced magnetic moment and the external field creates a force which tends to move the material from stronger part to weaker part of the external field. It means that diamagnetic material is repelled by the field.

This action is called diamagnetic action and such materials are known as diamagnetic materials. Examples: Bismuth, Copper and Water etc.

|------|




  

The properties of diamagnetic materials are i) Magnetic susceptibility is negative. ii) Relative permeability is slightly less than

unity. iii) The magnetic field lines are repelled or

expelled by diamagnetic materials when placed in a magnetic field.

iv) Susceptibility is nearly temperature independent.

Superconductors are perfect diamagnetic materials. The expulsion of magnetic

flux from a superconductor during its transition to the superconducting state is known as Meissner effect. (see figure 3.18)

**Note**

**B**

T > Tc T < Tc

**B**

**Figure 3.18 Meissner effect –** superconductors behave like perfect diamagnetic materials below transition temperature _TC_**.**

**(b) Paramagnetic materials** In some magnetic materials, each atom or

molecule has net magnetic dipole moment which is the vector sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of electrons. Due to the random orientation of these magnetic moments, the net magnetic moment of the materials is zero.  

In the presence of an external magnetic field, the torque acting on the atomic dipoles will align them in the field direction. As a result, there is net magnetic dipole moment induced in the direction of the applied field. The induced dipole moment is present as long as the external field exists.

When placed in a non-uniform magnetic field, the paramagnetic materials will have a tendency to move from weaker to stronger part of the field. Materials which exhibit weak magnetism in the direction of the applied field are known as paramagnetic materials.

**Magnetic levitated train** Magnetic levitated train

is also called Maglev train. This train floats few centimetres above the guideway because of electromagnet used. Maglev train does not need wheels and also achieve greater speed. The basic mechanism of working of Maglev train involves two sets of magnets. One set is used to repel which makes train to float above the track and another set is used to move the floating train ahead at very great speed. These trains are quieter, smoother and environmental friendly compared conventional trains and have potential for moving with much higher speeds with technology in future.




  

Examples: Aluminium, Platinum, Chromium and Oxygen etc.

The properties of paramagnetic materials are: i) Magnetic susceptibility is positive and

small. ii) Relative permeability is greater than

unity. iii) The magnetic field lines are attracted

vibration will upset the alignment of magnetic dipole moments. Therefore, the magnetic susceptibility decreases with increase in temperature. In many cases, the susceptibility of the materials is

**(c) Ferromagnetic materials** An atom or a molecule in a ferromagnetic

material possesses net magnetic dipole moment as in a paramagnetic material. A ferromagnetic material is made up of smaller regions, called ferromagnetic domains (Figure 3.20). Within each domain, the magnetic moments are spontaneously aligned in a direction. This alignment is caused by strong interaction arising from electron spin which depends on the inter-atomic distance. Each domain has net magnetisation in a direction. However the direction of magnetisation varies from domain to domain and thus net magnetisation of the specimen is zero.

![Magnetic domains – ferromagnetic materials](3.20.png "")

In the presence of external magnetic field, two processes take place

(1) The domains having magnetic moments parallel to the field grow bigger in size

(2) The other domains (not parallel to field) are rotated so that they are aligned with the field.

As a result of these mechanisms, there is a strong net magnetisation of the material in the direction of the applied field (Figure 3.21).

connection with archeological place Keezhadi To find whether any archeological structure e under the surface of a given place, well establi technique called ‘magnetometer surveying’ is u

In this technique, the variation of the magnetic field in comparison with the neighbouring place is studied. The magnetic field variation is due to the presence of magnetic mineral magnetite and its related minerals present in the archeological structures like buried wall, pottery, bricks, buried tombs, monuments and inhabited sites. Those minerals are either diamagnetic or paramagnetic or ferromagnetic in nature and each type has different range of magnetic susceptibilities.

When placed in a non-uniform magnetic field, the ferromagnetic materials will have a strong tendency to move from weaker to stronger part of the field. Materials which exhibit strong magnetism in the direction of applied field are called ferromagnetic materials. Examples: Iron, Nickel and Cobalt.

**Curie-Weiss law** As temperature increases, the

**Spin** Like mass and charge for particles, spin is also another

important attribute for an elementary particle. Spin is a quantum mechanical phenomenon which is responsible for magnetic properties of the material. Spin in quantum mechanics is entirely different from spin we encounter in classical mechanics. Spin in quantum mechanics does not mean rotation; it is intrinsic angular momentum which does not have classical analogue. For historical reason, the name spin is retained. Spin of a particle takes only positive values but the orientation of the spin vector takes plus or minus values in an external magnetic field. For an

example, electron has spin _s_ \= 1 2

. In the

presence of magnetic field, the spin will orient either parallel or anti-parallel to the direction of magnetic field.

## HYSTERESIS

When a ferromagnetic material is kept in a magnetising field, the material gets magnetised by induction. An important characteristic of ferromagnetic material is that the variation of magnetic induction 

_B_ with magnetising field 

_H_ is not linear.

It means that the ratio _B H_

\= µ is not a

constant. Let us study this behaviour in detail.

A ferromagnetic material (example, Iron) is magnetised slowly by a magnetising field

If the magnetising field is now reduced, the magnetic induction also decreases but does not retrace the original path CA. It takes different path CD. When the magnetising field is zero, the magnetic induction is not zero and it has positive value. This implies that some magnetism is left in the specimen even when _H_ = 0. The residual magnetism AD present in the specimen is called remanence or retentivity. **Remanence is defined as the ability of the materials to retain the magnetism in them even after the magnetising field disappears.**

In order to demagnetise the material, the magnetising field is gradually increased in the reverse direction. Now the magnetic induction decreases along DE and becomes zero at E. The magnetising field AE in the reverse direction is required to bring residual magnetism to zero. **The magnitude of the reverse magnetising field for which the residual magnetism of the material vanishes is called its coercivity.**

Further increase of 

_H_ in the reverse direction causes the magnetic induction to increase along EF until it reaches saturation at F in the reverse direction. If magnetising field is decreased and then increased with direction reversed, the magnetic induction traces the path FGKC. This closed curve ACDEFGKC is called hysteresis loop and it corresponds to one cycle of magnetisation.

In the entire cycle, the magnetic induction _B_ lags behind the magnetising field _H_. This **phenomenon of lagging of magnetic induction behind the magnetising field is called hysteresis.** Hysteresis means ‘lagging behind’.  

**Hysteresis loss** During the magnetisation of the

specimen through a cycle, there is loss of energy in the form of heat. This loss is attributed to the rotation and orientation of molecular magnets in various directions. It is found that the energy lost (or dissipated) per unit volume of the material when it is carried through one cycle of magnetisation is equal to the area of the hysteresis loop.

**Hard and soft magnetic materials** Based on the shape and size of

the hysteresis loop, ferromagnetic materials are classified as soft magnetic materials with smaller area and hard magnetic materials with larger area. The comparison of the hysteresis loops for two magnetic materials is shown in Figure 3.24. Properties of soft and hard magnetic materials are compared in Table 3.2.

**Applications of hysteresis loop** The significance of hysteresis loop is that

it provides information such as retentivity, coercivity, permeability, susceptibility and energy loss during one cycle of magnetisation for each ferromagnetic material. Therefore, the study of hysteresis loop will help us in selecting proper and suitable material for a given purpose. Some examples:

**i) Permanent magnets:** The materials with high retentivity, high

coercivity and low permeability are suitable for making permanent magnets. Examples: Carbon steel and Alnico

**ii) Electromagnets:** The materials with high initial

permeability, low retentivity, low coercivity and thin hysteresis loop with smaller area are preferred to make electromagnets.

Examples: Soft iron and Mumetal (Nickel Iron alloy).

**iii) Core of the transformer:** The materials with high initial

permeability, large magnetic induction and thin hysteresis loop with smaller area are needed to design transformer cores. **Examples:** Soft iron

## MAGNETIC EFFECTS OF CURRENT

### Oersted experiment

In 1820 Hans Christian Oersted, while preparing for his lecture in physics, noticed that electric current passing through a wire deflects the nearby magnetic needle in the compass. By proper investigation, he observed that the deflection of magnetic needle is due to the change in magnetic field produced around current carrying conductor (Figure 3.25). When the direction of current is reversed, the magnetic needle is deflected in the opposite direction. This lead to the development of the theory ‘electromagnetism’ which unifies two branches in physics namely, electricity and magnetism.

### Magnetic field around a straight current-carrying conductor and circular loop

**(a) Current carrying straight conductor:** Suppose we keep a magnetic compass

near a current-carrying straight conductor, then the needle of the magnetic compass experiences a torque and deflects to align in the direction of the magnetic field at that point. Tracing out the direction shown by magnetic needle , we can draw the magnetic field lines at a distance. For a straight current-carrying conductor, the nature of magnetic field is like concentric circles having their common centre on the axis of the conductor as shown in Figure 3.26 (a).

The direction of circular magnetic field lines will be clockwise or anticlockwise depending on the direction of current in the conductor. If the strength (or magnitude) of the current is increased then the density of the magnetic field will also increase. The strength of the magnetic field (_B_) decreases as the distance (_r_) from the conductor increases (Figure 3.26 (b)).

**(b) Circular coil carrying current** Suppose we keep a magnetic compass

near a current carrying circular conductor, then the needle of the magnetic compass experiences a torque and deflects to align in the direction of the magnetic field at that point. We can notice that at the points A and B in the vicinity of the coil, the magnetic field lines are circular. The magnetic field lines are nearly parallel to each other near the centre of the loop, indicating that the field present near the centre of the coil is almost uniform (Figure 3.27).

The strength of the magnetic field is increased if either the current in the coil or the number of turns or both are increased. The polarity (north pole or south pole) depends on the direction of current in the loop.

### Right hand thumb rule

The right hand rule is used to find the direction of magnetic field when the direction of current in a conductor is known.




  

**Assume that we hold the current carrying conductor in our right hand such that the thumb points in the direction of current flow, then the fingers encircling the conductor point in the direction of the magnetic field lines produced.**

This rule can also be used to find the direction of the magnetic field around the current-carrying conductor.

## BIOT - SAVART LAW

Soon after Oersted’s discovery, both Jean-Baptiste Biot and Felix Savart in 1819 did quantitative experiments on the force experienced by a magnet kept near current carrying wire and arrived at a mathematical expression that gives the magnetic field at some point in space in terms of the current that produces the magnetic field. This is true for any shape of the conductor.

### Magnetic field produced along the axis of the current-carrying circular coil

Consider a current carrying circular loop of radius _R_ and let _I_ be the current flowing through the wire in the direction as shown in Figure 3.33.

The magnetic field at a point P on the axis of the circular coil at a distance _z_ from the centre of the coil O is computed by taking two diametrically opposite line elements of the coil each of length _dl_



at C and D. Let _r_ be the vector joining the current element (_I dl_ 

) at C and the point P.

### Tangent law and Tangent Galvanometer

Tangent galvanometer is a device used to detect very small currents. It is a moving  

magnet type galvanometer. Its working is based on tangent law (Figure 3.34).

![Tangent Galvanometer](3.34.png "")

**Tangent law**

**When a magnetic needle or magnet is freely suspended in two mutually perpendicular uniform magnetic fields, it will come to rest in the direction of the resultant of the two fields.**

Let _B_ be the magnetic field produced by passing current through the coil of the tangent galvanometer and _BH_ be the horizontal component of Earth’s magnetic field. Under the action of two magnetic fields, the needle comes to rest making angle _θ_ with _BH_, such that

_B = BH_ tan _θ_ (3.39)

**Construction** Tangent Galvanometer (TG) consists

of copper coil of several turns wound on a non-magnetic circular frame. The frame is made up of brass or wood which is mounted vertically on a horizontal base table (turn table) with three levelling screws. The TG is provided with two or more coils of different number of turns. Most of the equipments we use in laboratory, contains coils of 2 turns, 5 turns and 50 turns which are of different thickness and are used for measuring currents of different strengths.

At the centre of turn table, there is a small upright projection on which a compass box is placed. Compass box consists of a small magnetic needle which is pivoted at its centre, such that the centres of both magnetic needle and circular coil exactly coincide. A thin aluminium pointer attached perpendicular to the magnetic needle moves over a graduated circular scale. The circular scale is divided into four quadrants and they are graduated in degrees, each quadrant being numbered from 0° to 90° In order to avoid parallax error in measurement, a mirror is placed below the aluminium pointer.

**Precautions** 1\. All the nearby magnets and magnetic

materials are kept away from the instrument. 2. Using spirit level, the levelling screws at

the base are adjusted so that the small magnetic needle is exactly horizontal and also coil (mounted on the frame) is exactly vertical.

3\. The plane of the coil is kept parallel to the small magnetic needle by rotating the coil about its vertical axis. So that, the coil remains in magnetic meridian.

4\. The compass box alone is rotated such that the aluminium pointer reads 0o – 0o.

**Theory** In the tangent galvanometer experiment,

when no current is passed through the coil, the small magnetic needle lies along horizontal component of Earth’s magnetic  

field. When the circuit is closed, the electric current will pass through the circular coil and produce magnetic field at the centre of the coil. Now there are two fields which are acting mutually perpendicular to each other. They are: (1) the magnetic field (_B_) due to the electric

current in the coil acting normal to the plane of the coil.

(2) the horizontal component of Earth’s magnetic field (_BH_)

![Resultant position of pivoted needle](3.35.png "")

Because of these crossed fields, the pivoted magnetic needle deflects through an angle _θ_. From tangent law (equation 3.39),

_B = BH_ tan _θ_

When an electric current is passed through a circular coil of radius _R_ having _N_ turns, the magnitude of magnetic field at the centre is (from equation (3.38))

**_Solution_** The diameter of the coil is 0.24 m. Therefore, radius of the coil is 0.12 m.

Number of turns is 100 turns.

_p I Am_ \= (3.44)

This implies that a current carrying circular loop behaves as a magnetic dipole of magnetic moment _pm_ . So, **the magnetic dipole moment of any current loop is equal to the product of the current and area of the loop.**

**Right hand thumb rule** In order to determine the direction of

magnetic moment, we use right hand thumb rule which states that

**If we curl the fingers of right hand in the direction of current in the loop, then the stretched thumb gives the direction of the magnetic moment associated with the loop.**

**Table 3.3 End rule – polarity with direction of current in circular loop**

## AMPÈRE’S CIRCUITAL LAW

Ampère’s circuital law is used to calculate magnetic field at a point whenever there is a  

symmetry in the problem. This is similar to Gauss’s law in electrostatics.

Consider a straight conductor of infinite length carrying current _I_ and

Since the wire is geometrically cylindrical in shape and symmetrical about its axis, we construct an Ampèrian loop in the form of a circular shape at a distance _r_ from the centre of the conductor as shown in Figure 3.37. From the Ampère’s law, we get

**Solenoid** A solenoid is a long coil of wire closely

wound in the form of helix as shown in Figure 3.38. When electric current is passed through the solenoid, the magnetic field is produced. The magnetic field of the solenoid is due to the superposition of magnetic fields of each turn of the solenoid. The direction of magnetic field due to solenoid is given by right hand palm-rule.

Inside the solenoid, the magnetic field is nearly uniform and parallel to its axis whereas, outside the solenoid the field is negligibly small. Based on the direction of the current, one end of the solenoid behaves like North Pole and the other end behaves like South Pole.

The current carrying solenoid is held in right hand. If the fingers curl in the direction of current, then extended thumb gives the direction of magnetic field of current carrying solenoid. It is shown in

Since _n_ is a constant for a given solenoid and μ0 is also constant. For a fixed current _I_, the magnetic field inside the solenoid is also a constant.  

Solenoid can be used as electromagnet. It produces strong magnetic field that

can be turned ON or OFF. This is not possible in case of permanent magnet. Further the strength of the magnetic field can be increased by keeping iron bar inside the solenoid. This is because the magnetic field of the solenoid magnetizes the iron bar and hence the net magnetic field is the sum of magnetic field of the solenoid and magnetic field of magnetised iron. Because of these properties, solenoids are useful in designing variety of electrical appliances.

**Note**

**EXAMPLE 3.16**

Calculate the magnetic field inside a solenoid, when

(a) the length of the solenoid becomes twice with fixed number of turns

(b) both the length of the solenoid and number of turns are doubled

(c) the number of turns becomes twice for the fixed length of the solenoid

Compare the results.

**_Solution_** The magnetic field of a solenoid (inside) is

_B NI LL N_, = µ



(a) length of the solenoid becomes twice with fixed number of turns

MRI is Magnetic Resonance Imaging which helps the physicians to diagonise or monitor treatment for a variety of abnormal conditions happening within the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis. It is a non invasive medical test. The patient is placed in a circular opening (actually interior of a solenoid which is made up of superconducting wire) and large current is sent through the superconducting wire to produce a strong magnetic field. So, it uses more powerful magnet, radio frequency pulses and a computer to produce pictures of organs which helps the physicians to examine various parts of the body.  

(c) the number of turns becomes twice but the length of the solenoid remains same

Thus, strength of the magnetic field is increased when we pack more loops into the same length for a given current.

### Toroid

A solenoid is bent in such a way its ends are joined together to form a closed ring shape, is called a toroid which is shown in Figure 3.42. The magnetic field has constant magnitude inside the toroid whereas in the interior region (say, at point P) and exterior region (say, at point Q), the magnetic field is zero.

![Toroid](3.42.png "")

**(a) Open space interior to the toroid** Let us calculate the magnetic field _BP_ at

## LORENTZ FORCE

When an electric charge _q_ is kept at rest in a magnetic field, no force acts on it. At the same time, if the charge moves in the magnetic field, it experiences a force. This force is different from Coulomb force, studied in unit 1. This force is known as magnetic force. It is given by the equation







_F q B_\= ×( )_v_ (3.54)

In general, if the charge is moving in both the electric and magnetic fields, the total force experienced by the charge is given by

 





_F q E B_\= + ×( )_v_ . It is known as Lorentz force.

### Force on a moving charge in a magnetic field

When an electric charge _q_ is moving with velocity _v_ in the magnetic field



_B_ , it experiences a force, called magnetic force 

_Fm_ . After careful experiments, Lorentz deduced the force experienced by a moving charge in the magnetic field



_Fm_ 





_F q Bm_ \= ×( )_v_ (3.55)

In magnitude, _F q Bm_ \= _v_ sinθ (3.56)

The equations (3.55) and (3.56) imply

1\. 

_Fm_ is directly proportional to the magnetic field



_B_ 2\. 

_Fm_ is directly proportional to the velocity _v_ of the moving charge  

3\. 

_Fm_ is directly proportional to sine of the angle between the velocity and magnetic field

4\. 

_Fm_ is directly proportional to the magnitude of the charge _q_

5\. The direction of 

_Fm_ is always perpendicular to _v_ and



_Fm_ is the cross product of _v_ and

![Circular motion of a charged particle in a perpendicular uniform magnetic field](3.45.png "")

Consider a charged particle of charge _q_ having mass _m_ entering into a region of uniform magnetic field



_B_ with velocity  

_v_´_B_ such that velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field. As soon as the particle enters into the field, Lorentz force acts on it in a direction perpendicular to both magnetic field



_B_ and velocity  

_v_´_B_. As a result, the charged particle moves

in a circular orbit as shown in Figure 3.45. The Lorentz force on the charged particle is given by  







_F q B_\= ×( )_v_

Since Lorentz force alone acts on the particle, the magnitude of the net force on the particle is

_F F q Bi i_

_m_∑ = = _v_

This Lorentz force acts as centripetal force for the particle causing it to execute circular motion. Therefore,

_q B m r_

_v v_\= 2

The radius of the circular path is

_r m qB_

_p qB_

\= =_v_ (3.57)

where _p = mv_ is the magnitude of the linear momentum of the particle. Let _T_ be the time taken by the particle to finish one complete circular motion, then

_T r_ \=

2π _v_

(3.58)

Hence substituting (3.57) in (3.58), we get

_T m qB_

\= 2π (3.59)

Equation (3.59) is called the **cyclotron period**. The reciprocal of time period is the frequency _f_, which is

_f T_

\= 1

_f qB m_

\= 2π

(3.60)

In terms of angular frequency ω,

ω π= =2 _f q m_

_B_ (3.61)




  

Equations (3.60) and (3.61) are called as **cyclotron frequency or gyro-frequency**.

From equations (3.59), (3.60) and (3.61), we infer that time period and frequency depend only on charge-to-mass ratio (specific charge) but not on velocity or the radius of the circular path.

If a charged particle moves in a region of uniform magnetic field such that its velocity is not perpendicular to the magnetic field, then the velocity of the particle is split up into two components; one component is parallel to the field while the other component perpendicular to the field. The component of velocity parallel to field remains unchanged and the component perpendicular to the field keeps changing due to Lorentz force. Hence the path of the particle is not a circle; it is a helical around the field lines as shown in Figure 3.46.

For an example, the helical path of an electron when it moves in a magnetic field is shown in Figure 3.47. Inside the particle detector called cloud chamber, the path is made visible by the condensation of water droplets.

This speed is independent of mass and

By proper choice of electric and magnetic fields, the particle with particular speed can be selected. Such an arrangement of fields is called a **velocity selector**.

Let _E_ be the electric field of magnitude 6.0 × 106 N C–1 and _B_ be the magnetic field magnitude 0.83 T. Suppose an electron is accelerated with a potential of 200 V, will it show zero deflection?. If not, at what potential will it show zero deflection.

**Construction** The schematic diagram of a cyclotron

is shown in Figure 3.50. The particles are allowed to move in between two semi- circular metal containers called Dees (hollow D - shaped objects). Dees are enclosed in an evacuated chamber and it is kept in a region with uniform magnetic field controlled by an electromagnet. The direction of magnetic field is normal to the plane of the Dees. The two Dees are kept separated with a gap and the source S (which ejects the particle to be accelerated) is placed at the centre in the gap between the Dees. Dees are connected to high frequency alternating potential difference.

**Working** Let us assume that the ion ejected from

source S is positively charged. As soon as ion is ejected, it is accelerated towards a Dee (say, Dee – 1) which has negative potential at that time. Since the magnetic field is normal to the plane of the Dees, the ion moves in a circular path. After one semi-circular path inside Dee-1, the ion reaches the gap between Dees. At this time, the polarities  

of the Dees are reversed so that the ion is now accelerated towards Dee-2 with a greater velocity. For this circular motion, the centripetal force on the charged particle _q_ is provided by Lorentz force.

From the equation (3.63), the increase in velocity increases the radius of circular path. This process continues and hence the particle moves in spiral path of increasing radius. Once it reaches near the edge, it is taken out with the help of deflector plate and allowed to hit the target T.

The important condition in cyclotron operation is that when the frequency _f_ at which the positive ion circulates in the magnetic field must be equal to the constant frequency of the electrical oscillator _f_osc . This is called resonance condition.

From equation (3.60), we have

Deutrons (bundles of one proton and one neutron) can be accelerated because it has

same charge as that of proton. But neutron (electrically neutral particle) cannot be accelerated by the cyclotron. When a deutron is bombarded with a beryllium target, a beam of high energy neutrons are produced. These high-energy neutrons are sent into the patient’s cancerous region to break the bonds in the DNA of the cancer cells (killing the cells). This is used in treatment of fast-neutron cancer therapy.

### Force on a current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field

When a current carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, the force experienced by the conductor is equal to the sum of Lorentz forces on the individual charge carriers in the conductor. Consider a small segment of conductor of length _dl_, with cross-sectional area _A_  

and current _I_ as shown in Figure 3.51. The free electrons drift opposite to the direction of current. So the relation between current _I_ and magnitude of drift velocity _v_d (Refer Unit 2) is

_I = neAvd_ (3.65)

If the conductor is kept in a magnetic field



_B_ , then average force experienced by the charge (electron) in the conductor is

( )   _f e v Bd_\= − ×

If _n_ is the number of free electrons present in unit volume, then

_n N V_

where _N_ is the number of free electrons in the small element of volume _V_ = _Adl_.

Hence Lorentz force on the elementary section of length _dl_ is the product of the number of the electrons (_N_ = _nAdl_) and the force acting on each electron.

Thus the force on a straight current carrying conductor of length _l_ placed in a uniform magnetic field is

r r r _F l B_\= ×( )total _I_ (3.67)

In magnitude,

_F BIl_\= sinθtotal

(a) If the conductor is placed along the direction of the magnetic field, the angle then _θ_ \= 0o. Hence, the force experienced by the conductor is zero.

(b) If the conductor is placed perpendicular to the magnetic field, then the angle _θ_ =90o Hence, the force experienced by the conductor is maximum, which is _F_total _= BIl_.

**Fleming’s left hand rule** When a current carrying conductor is

placed in a magnetic field, the direction of the force experienced by it is given by Fleming’s Left Hand Rule (FLHR) as shown in Figure 3.52.

**EXAMPLE 3.24**

A metallic rod of linear density is 0.25 kg m–1 is lying horizontally on a smooth inclined plane which makes an angle of 45o with the horizontal.

The magnitude of the force on the arm

Since the forces _FQR_ and _FSP_ are equal, opposite and collinear, they cancel each other. But the forces _FPQ_ and _FRS_ , which are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, are not acting along same straight line.

### Moving coil galvanometer

Moving coil galvanometer is a device which is used to detect the flow of current in an electrical circuit.

**Principle** When a current carrying loop is placed in a uniform magnetic field, it experiences a torque.

**Construction** A moving coil galvanometer consists

of a rectangular coil PQRS of insulated thin copper wire. The coil contains a large number of turns wound over a light metallic frame. A cylindrical soft-iron core is placed symmetrically inside the coil as shown in Figure 3.59. The rectangular coil is suspended freely between two pole pieces of a horse-shoe magnet.

The upper end of the rectangular coil is attached to one end of fine strip of phosphor bronze and the lower end of the coil is connected to a hair spring which is also made up of phosphor bronze. In a fine suspension strip, a small plane mirror is attached in order to measure the deflection of the coil with the help of lamp and scale arrangement. The other end of the mirror is connected to a torsion head. In order to pass electric current through the galvanometer, the suspension strip and the spring S are connected to terminals.  

**Working** Consider a single turn of the rectangular

coil PQRS whose length is _l_ and breadth _b_. PQ = RS = _l_ and QR = SP = _b_. Let _I_ be the electric current flowing through the rectangular coil PQRS as shown in Figure 3.60. The horse-shoe magnet has hemi - spherical magnetic poles which produces a radial magnetic field. Due to this radial field, the sides QR and SP are always parallel to the magnetic field _B_ and experience no force. The sides PQ and RS are always perpendicular to the magnetic field and experience equal forces in opposite directions. Due to this, torque is produced.

For single turn, the deflecting torque is τ = _bF_ = _bBIl_\= (_lb_) _BI_ = _ABI_ since area of the coil, _A_ = _lb_ For coil with _N_ turns, we get

Coil

**N S**

Translucent scale

τ = _NABI_ (3.69)

Due to this deflecting torque, the coil gets twisted and restoring torque (also known as restoring couple) is developed. Hence the moment of the restoring torque is proportional to the amount of twist _θ_.Thus

τ = _K_ _θ_ (3.70)

where _K_ is the restoring couple per unit twist.

At equilibrium, the deflecting couple must be equal to the restoring couple. Therefore we get,

_NABI K_\= θ

⇒ =_I K NAB_

θ (3.71)

(or) _I_ \= _G_ θ

where _G K NAB_

constant or current reduction factor of the galvanometer.

Since the suspended moving coil galvanometer is very sensitive, we have to handle with high care while doing experiments. Most of the galvanometer we use are pointer type moving coil galvanometer.

A galvanometer is converted into an ammeter by connecting a low resistance in parallel with the galvanometer. This low resistance is called shunt resistance _S_. The scale is now calibrated in ampere and the range of ammeter depends on the values of the shunt resistance.

Let _I_ be the current passing through the circuit as shown in Figure 3.61. When current _I_ reaches the junction A, it divides into two components. Let _Ig_ be the current passing through the galvanometer of resistance _Rg_ through a path AGE and the remaining current (_I_ – _Ig_) passes along the path ACDE through shunt resistance _S_. The value of shunt resistance is so adjusted that current _Ig_ produces full scale deflection in the galvanometer. The potential difference across galvanometer is same as the potential difference across shunt resistance.

the deflection produced in the galvanometer is a measure of the current _I_ passing through the circuit.

Since, the shunt resistance is a very

For an ideal ammeter, the resistance must be equal to zero. But in reality, the reading in ammeter is always less than the actual current in the circuit. Let _Iideal_ be the current measured by ideal ammeter and _Iactual_ be the actual current in the circuit. Then, the percentage error in measuring a current through an ammeter is

**Galvanometer to a voltmeter**

A voltmeter is an instrument used to measure potential difference across any two points in the electrical circuits. It should not draw any current from the circuit otherwise the value of potential difference to be measured will change.

Voltmeter must have high resistance and when it is connected in parallel, it will not draw appreciable current so that it will indicate the true potential difference.

The scale is now calibrated in volt and the range of voltmeter depends on the values of the resistance _Rh_ connected in series i.e. the value of resistance is so adjusted so that current _Ig_ produces full scale deflection in the galvanometer.

Let _Rg_ be the resistance of galvanometer and _Ig_ be the current with which the galvanometer produces full scale deflection. Since the galvanometer is connected in series with high resistance, the current in the electrical circuit is same as the current passing through the galvanometer.  

_I = Ig_

_I I Ig g_\= ⇒ = potential difference

total resistance

Since the galvanometer and high resistance are connected in series, the total resistance or effective resistance in the circuit is the sum of their resistances. This gives the resistance of voltmeter. Thus the voltmeter resistance is

_R R Rv g h_\= +

Therefore,

_I V R R_

_R V I_

_R_

_g g h_

_h g_

_g_

\= +

⇒ = −

Note that _I Vg_ ∝

The deflection in the galvanometer is proportional to current _Ig_. But current _Ig_ is proportional to the potential difference. Hence the deflection in the galvanometer is a measure of potential difference. Since the resistance of voltmeter is very large, a voltmeter connected in parallel in an electrical circuit will draw least current in the circuit. An ideal voltmeter is one which has infinite resistance.

**Key points** 1\. Voltmeter is a high resistance instrument

and it is always connected in parallel with the circuit element across which the potential difference is to be measured.

2\. An ideal voltmeter has infinite resistance

3\. In order to increase the range of voltmeter _n_ times the value of resistance to be connected in series with galvanometer is

_Rh = (n-1) Rg_
