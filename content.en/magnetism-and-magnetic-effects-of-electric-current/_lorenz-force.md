## LORENTZ FORCE

When an electric charge _q_ is kept at rest in a magnetic field, no force acts on it. At the same time, if the charge moves in the magnetic field, it experiences a force. This force is different from Coulomb force, studied in unit 1. This force is known as magnetic force. It is given by the equation







_F q B_\= ×( )_v_ (3.54)

In general, if the charge is moving in both the electric and magnetic fields, the total force experienced by the charge is given by

 





_F q E B_\= + ×( )_v_ . It is known as Lorentz force.

### Force on a moving charge in a magnetic field

When an electric charge _q_ is moving with velocity _v_ in the magnetic field



_B_ , it experiences a force, called magnetic force 

_Fm_ . After careful experiments, Lorentz deduced the force experienced by a moving charge in the magnetic field



_Fm_ 





_F q Bm_ \= ×( )_v_ (3.55)

In magnitude, _F q Bm_ \= _v_ sinθ (3.56)

The equations (3.55) and (3.56) imply

1\. 

_Fm_ is directly proportional to the magnetic field



_B_ 2\. 

_Fm_ is directly proportional to the velocity _v_ of the moving charge  

3\. 

_Fm_ is directly proportional to sine of the angle between the velocity and magnetic field

4\. 

_Fm_ is directly proportional to the magnitude of the charge _q_

5\. The direction of 

_Fm_ is always perpendicular to _v_ and



_B_ as 

_Fm_ is the cross product of _v_ and



_Fm_ on negative charge is opposite to the direction of

7\. If velocity _v_ of the charge _q_ is along magnetic field



_B_ then, 

_Fm_ is zero

**Definition of tesla** The strength of the magnetic field is one

Thus Lorentz force changes the direction of the velocity but not the magnitude of the velocity. Hence Lorentz force does no work and also does not alter kinetic energy of the particle.

![Circular motion of a charged particle in a perpendicular uniform magnetic field](3.45.png "")

Consider a charged particle of charge _q_ having mass _m_ entering into a region of uniform magnetic field



_B_ with velocity  

_v_´_B_ such that velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field. As soon as the particle enters into the field, Lorentz force acts on it in a direction perpendicular to both magnetic field



_B_ and velocity  

_v_´_B_. As a result, the charged particle moves

in a circular orbit as shown in Figure 3.45. The Lorentz force on the charged particle is given by  







_F q B_\= ×( )_v_

Since Lorentz force alone acts on the particle, the magnitude of the net force on the particle is

_F F q Bi i_

_m_∑ = = _v_

This Lorentz force acts as centripetal force for the particle causing it to execute circular motion. Therefore,

_q B m r_

_v v_\= 2

The radius of the circular path is

_r m qB_

_p qB_

\= =_v_ (3.57)

where _p = mv_ is the magnitude of the linear momentum of the particle. Let _T_ be the time taken by the particle to finish one complete circular motion, then

_T r_ \=

2π _v_

(3.58)

Hence substituting (3.57) in (3.58), we get

_T m qB_

\= 2π (3.59)

Equation (3.59) is called the **cyclotron period**. The reciprocal of time period is the frequency _f_, which is

_f T_

\= 1

_f qB m_

\= 2π

(3.60)

In terms of angular frequency ω,

ω π= =2 _f q m_

_B_ (3.61)




  

Equations (3.60) and (3.61) are called as **cyclotron frequency or gyro-frequency**.

From equations (3.59), (3.60) and (3.61), we infer that time period and frequency depend only on charge-to-mass ratio (specific charge) but not on velocity or the radius of the circular path.

If a charged particle moves in a region of uniform magnetic field such that its velocity is not perpendicular to the magnetic field, then the velocity of the particle is split up into two components; one component is parallel to the field while the other component perpendicular to the field. The component of velocity parallel to field remains unchanged and the component perpendicular to the field keeps changing due to Lorentz force. Hence the path of the particle is not a circle; it is a helical around the field lines as shown in Figure 3.46.

For an example, the helical path of an electron when it moves in a magnetic field is shown in Figure 3.47. Inside the particle detector called cloud chamber, the path is made visible by the condensation of water droplets.

Note that even though the difference between mass of two isotopes are very small, this arrangement helps us to convert this small difference into an easily measurable distance of separation. This arrangement is known as mass spectrometer. A mass spectrometer is used in many areas in sciences, especially in medicine, in space science, in geology etc. For example, in medicine, anaesthesiologists use it to measure the respiratory gases and biologist use it to determine the reaction mechanisms in photosynthesis.

This speed is independent of mass and

charge.

By proper choice of electric and magnetic fields, the particle with particular speed can be selected. Such an arrangement of fields is called a **velocity selector**.

**EXAMPLE 3.22**

Let _E_ be the electric field of magnitude 6.0 × 106 N C–1 and _B_ be the magnetic field magnitude 0.83 T. Suppose an electron is accelerated with a potential of 200 V, will it show zero deflection?. If not, at what potential will it show zero deflection.

### Cyclotron

Cyclotron (Figure 3.49) is a device used to accelerate the charged particles to gain large kinetic energy. It is also called as high energy accelerator. It was invented by Lawrence and Livingston in 1934. **Principle**

When a charged particle moves perpendicular to the magnetic field, it experiences magnetic Lorentz force.

**Construction** The schematic diagram of a cyclotron

is shown in Figure 3.50. The particles are allowed to move in between two semi- circular metal containers called Dees (hollow D - shaped objects). Dees are enclosed in an evacuated chamber and it is kept in a region with uniform magnetic field controlled by an electromagnet. The direction of magnetic field is normal to the plane of the Dees. The two Dees are kept separated with a gap and the source S (which ejects the particle to be accelerated) is placed at the centre in the gap between the Dees. Dees are connected to high frequency alternating potential difference.

**Working** Let us assume that the ion ejected from

source S is positively charged. As soon as ion is ejected, it is accelerated towards a Dee (say, Dee – 1) which has negative potential at that time. Since the magnetic field is normal to the plane of the Dees, the ion moves in a circular path. After one semi-circular path inside Dee-1, the ion reaches the gap between Dees. At this time, the polarities  

of the Dees are reversed so that the ion is now accelerated towards Dee-2 with a greater velocity. For this circular motion, the centripetal force on the charged particle _q_ is provided by Lorentz force.

From the equation (3.63), the increase in velocity increases the radius of circular path. This process continues and hence the particle moves in spiral path of increasing radius. Once it reaches near the edge, it is taken out with the help of deflector plate and allowed to hit the target T.

The important condition in cyclotron operation is that when the frequency _f_ at which the positive ion circulates in the magnetic field must be equal to the constant frequency of the electrical oscillator _f_osc . This is called resonance condition.

From equation (3.60), we have

Deutrons (bundles of one proton and one neutron) can be accelerated because it has

same charge as that of proton. But neutron (electrically neutral particle) cannot be accelerated by the cyclotron. When a deutron is bombarded with a beryllium target, a beam of high energy neutrons are produced. These high-energy neutrons are sent into the patient’s cancerous region to break the bonds in the DNA of the cancer cells (killing the cells). This is used in treatment of fast-neutron cancer therapy.

### Force on a current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field

When a current carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, the force experienced by the conductor is equal to the sum of Lorentz forces on the individual charge carriers in the conductor. Consider a small segment of conductor of length _dl_, with cross-sectional area _A_  

and current _I_ as shown in Figure 3.51. The free electrons drift opposite to the direction of current. So the relation between current _I_ and magnitude of drift velocity _v_d (Refer Unit 2) is

_I = neAvd_ (3.65)

If the conductor is kept in a magnetic field



_B_ , then average force experienced by the charge (electron) in the conductor is

( )   _f e v Bd_\= − ×

If _n_ is the number of free electrons present in unit volume, then

_n N V_

\=

where _N_ is the number of free electrons in the small element of volume _V_ = _Adl_.

Hence Lorentz force on the elementary section of length _dl_ is the product of the number of the electrons (_N_ = _nAdl_) and the force acting on each electron.

Thus the force on a straight current carrying conductor of length _l_ placed in a uniform magnetic field is

r r r _F l B_\= ×( )total _I_ (3.67)

In magnitude,

_F BIl_\= sinθtotal

(a) If the conductor is placed along the direction of the magnetic field, the angle then _θ_ \= 0o. Hence, the force experienced by the conductor is zero.

(b) If the conductor is placed perpendicular to the magnetic field, then the angle _θ_ =90o Hence, the force experienced by the conductor is maximum, which is _F_total _= BIl_.

**Fleming’s left hand rule** When a current carrying conductor is

placed in a magnetic field, the direction of the force experienced by it is given by Fleming’s Left Hand Rule (FLHR) as shown in Figure 3.52.

Stretch out forefinger, the middle finger and the thumb of the left hand such that they are in three mutually perpendicular directions. If the forefinger points in the direction of magnetic field,  

the middle finger in the direction of the electric current, then thumb will point in the direction of the force experienced by the conductor.

**EXAMPLE 3.24**

A metallic rod of linear density is 0.25 kg m–1 is lying horizontally on a smooth inclined plane which makes an angle of 45o with the horizontal. The rod is not allowed to slide down by flowing a current through it when a magnetic field of strength 0.25 T is acting on it in the vertical direction. Calculate the electric current flowing in the rod to keep it stationary.

### Force between two long parallel current carrying conductors

Let _I_1 and _I_2 be the electric currents passing through the conductors A and B in same direction (i.e. along z - direction) respectively. The net magnetic field at a distance _r_ due to current _I_1 in conductor A is
