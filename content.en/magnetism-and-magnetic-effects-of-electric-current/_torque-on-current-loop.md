## TORQUE ON A CURRENT LOOP

The force on a current carrying wire in a magnetic field is responsible for the motor operation.

### Torque on a current loop placed in a magnetic field

Consider a rectangular loop PQRS carrying current _I_ is placed in a uniform magnetic field



_B_ . Let _a_ and _b_ be the length and breadth of rectangular loop respectively. The unit vector _n ˆ_ normal to the plane of the




  

loop makes an angle _θ_ with the magnetic field as shown in Figure 3.57.

The magnitude of the magnetic force acting on the current-carrying arm PQ is _F IaB IaBPQ_ \= ( )=sin _p_

2 . The direction

of the force is found using right hand cork screw rule and its direction is upwards.

The magnitude of the force on the arm

QR is _F IbB IbBQR_ \= ( )=−sin cos_π θθ_2

and its direction is as shown in Figure 3.57. The magnitude of the force on the arm RS

is _F IaB IaBRS_ \= ( )=sin _p_ 2 and its direction

is downwards. The magnitude of the force acting on the

arm SP is _F IbB IbBSP_ \= +( )=sin cos_π θθ_2

and its direction is also as shown in the Figure 3.57.

Since the forces _FQR_ and _FSP_ are equal, opposite and collinear, they cancel each other. But the forces _FPQ_ and _FRS_ , which are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, are not acting along same straight line. Therefore, _FPQ_ and _FRS_ constitute a couple which exerts a torque on the loop.

**Special cases:** (a) When _θ_ \= 90°or the plane of the loop

is parallel to the magnetic field, the torque on the current loop is maximum.

τmax = _IAB_

(b) When _θ_ \= 0°/180° or the plane of the loop is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the torque on the current loop is zero.

### Moving coil galvanometer

Moving coil galvanometer is a device which is used to detect the flow of current in an electrical circuit.

**Principle** When a current carrying loop is placed in a uniform magnetic field, it experiences a torque.

**Construction** A moving coil galvanometer consists

of a rectangular coil PQRS of insulated thin copper wire. The coil contains a large number of turns wound over a light metallic frame. A cylindrical soft-iron core is placed symmetrically inside the coil as shown in Figure 3.59. The rectangular coil is suspended freely between two pole pieces of a horse-shoe magnet.

The upper end of the rectangular coil is attached to one end of fine strip of phosphor bronze and the lower end of the coil is connected to a hair spring which is also made up of phosphor bronze. In a fine suspension strip, a small plane mirror is attached in order to measure the deflection of the coil with the help of lamp and scale arrangement. The other end of the mirror is connected to a torsion head. In order to pass electric current through the galvanometer, the suspension strip and the spring S are connected to terminals.  

**Working** Consider a single turn of the rectangular

coil PQRS whose length is _l_ and breadth _b_. PQ = RS = _l_ and QR = SP = _b_. Let _I_ be the electric current flowing through the rectangular coil PQRS as shown in Figure 3.60. The horse-shoe magnet has hemi - spherical magnetic poles which produces a radial magnetic field. Due to this radial field, the sides QR and SP are always parallel to the magnetic field _B_ and experience no force. The sides PQ and RS are always perpendicular to the magnetic field and experience equal forces in opposite directions. Due to this, torque is produced.

For single turn, the deflecting torque is τ = _bF_ = _bBIl_\= (_lb_) _BI_ = _ABI_ since area of the coil, _A_ = _lb_ For coil with _N_ turns, we get

τ = _NABI_ (3.69)

Due to this deflecting torque, the coil gets twisted and restoring torque (also known as restoring couple) is developed. Hence the moment of the restoring torque is proportional to the amount of twist _θ_.Thus

τ = _K_ _θ_ (3.70)

where _K_ is the restoring couple per unit twist.

At equilibrium, the deflecting couple must be equal to the restoring couple. Therefore we get,

_NABI K_\= θ

⇒ =_I K NAB_

θ (3.71)

(or) _I_ \= _G_ θ

where _G K NAB_

\= is called galvanometer

constant or current reduction factor of the galvanometer.

Since the suspended moving coil galvanometer is very sensitive, we have to handle with high care while doing experiments. Most of the galvanometer we use are pointer type moving coil galvanometer.

The current sensitivity of a galvanometer can be increased by

twist of the suspension wire, _K_. Phosphor - bronze wire is used as the

suspension wire because the couple per unit twist is very small.

**Conversion of galvanometer into ammeter and voltmeter**

A galvanometer is very sensitive instrument to detect the current. It can be easily converted into ammeter and voltmeter.

**Galvanometer to an Ammeter**

Ammeter is an instrument used to measure current flowing in the electrical circuit. The ammeter must offer low resistance such that it will not change the current passing through it. So ammeter is connected in series to measure the circuit current.

A galvanometer is converted into an ammeter by connecting a low resistance in parallel with the galvanometer. This low resistance is called shunt resistance _S_. The scale is now calibrated in ampere and the range of ammeter depends on the values of the shunt resistance.

Let _I_ be the current passing through the circuit as shown in Figure 3.61. When current _I_ reaches the junction A, it divides into two components. Let _Ig_ be the current passing through the galvanometer of resistance _Rg_ through a path AGE and the remaining current (_I_ – _Ig_) passes along the path ACDE through shunt resistance _S_. The value of shunt resistance is so adjusted that current _Ig_ produces full scale deflection in the galvanometer. The potential difference across galvanometer is same as the potential difference across shunt resistance.

_I I Ig g_ So,

the deflection produced in the galvanometer is a measure of the current _I_ passing through the circuit.

Shunt resistance is connected in parallel to galvanometer. Therefore, resistance of ammeter (_Ra_) can be determined by computing the effective resistance, which is

Since, the shunt resistance is a very

low resistance and the ratio _S Rg_

is also

small. This means, _Ra_ is also small, i.e., the resistance offered by the ammeter is small. So, when we connect ammeter in series, the ammeter will not change appreciably the current in the circuit. For an ideal ammeter, the resistance must be equal to zero. But in reality, the reading in ammeter is always less than the actual current in the circuit. Let _Iideal_ be the current measured by ideal ammeter and _Iactual_ be the actual current in the circuit. Then, the percentage error in measuring a current through an ammeter is

**Galvanometer to a voltmeter**

A voltmeter is an instrument used to measure potential difference across any two points in the electrical circuits. It should not draw any current from the circuit otherwise the value of potential difference to be measured will change.

Voltmeter must have high resistance and when it is connected in parallel, it will not draw appreciable current so that it will indicate the true potential difference.

A galvanometer is converted into a voltmeter by connecting high resistance _Rh_ in series with galvanometer as shown in Figure 3.62. The scale is now calibrated in volt and the range of voltmeter depends on the values of the resistance _Rh_ connected in series i.e. the value of resistance is so adjusted so that current _Ig_ produces full scale deflection in the galvanometer.

Let _Rg_ be the resistance of galvanometer and _Ig_ be the current with which the galvanometer produces full scale deflection. Since the galvanometer is connected in series with high resistance, the current in the electrical circuit is same as the current passing through the galvanometer.  

_I = Ig_

_I I Ig g_\= ⇒ = potential difference

total resistance

Since the galvanometer and high resistance are connected in series, the total resistance or effective resistance in the circuit is the sum of their resistances. This gives the resistance of voltmeter. Thus the voltmeter resistance is

_R R Rv g h_\= +

Note that _I Vg_ ∝

The deflection in the galvanometer is proportional to current _Ig_. But current _Ig_ is proportional to the potential difference. Hence the deflection in the galvanometer is a measure of potential difference. Since the resistance of voltmeter is very large, a voltmeter connected in parallel in an electrical circuit will draw least current in the circuit. An ideal voltmeter is one which has infinite resistance.

**Key points** 1\. Voltmeter is a high resistance instrument

and it is always connected in parallel with the circuit element across which the potential difference is to be measured.

2\. An ideal voltmeter has infinite resistance

3\. In order to increase the range of voltmeter _n_ times the value of resistance to be connected in series with galvanometer is

_Rh = (n-1) Rg_
