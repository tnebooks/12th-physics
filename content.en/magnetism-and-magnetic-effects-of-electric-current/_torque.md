## TORQUE ACTING ON A BAR MAGNET IN UNIFORM MAGNETIC FIELD

Consider a magnet of length 2_l_ and pole strength _qm_ kept in a uniform magnetic field

ÔÅ≤

_B_ as shown in Figure 3.16. Each pole experiences a force of magnitude _qmB_ but acting in opposite directions. Therefore, the net force exerted on the magnet is zero and hence, there is no translatory motion. These two equal and opposite forces constitute a couple (about midpoint of bar magnet) tend to align the magnet in the direction of the magnetic field

ÔÅ≤

_B_.

(a) Why a freely suspended bar magnet in your laboratory experiences only

torque (rotational motion) but not any translatory motion even though Earth has non-uniform magnetic field?

It is because Earth‚Äôs magnetic field is locally(physics laboratory)uniform. (b) Suppose we keep a freely suspended

bar magnet in a non-uniform magnetic field. What will happen? It will undergo translatory motion

(net force) and rotational motion (torque).




  

torque œÑ _B_ at constant angular velocity, then the work done by external torque ÔÅ≤ _ext_  for this small angular displacement is given by

The bar magnet has to be moved at constant angular velocity, which implies that ÔÅ≤ ÔÅ≤ _B ext_

This work done is stored as potential energy in bar magnet at an angle _Œ∏_ (when it is rotated from _Œ∏Õ¥_ to _Œ∏_) and it can be written as

_U p Bm_   (cos cos )  (3.26)

In fact, the equation (3.26) gives the difference in potential energy between the angular positions _Œ∏Õ¥_ and _Œ∏_. If we choose the reference point as _Œ∏Õ¥_ = 90o, so that second term in the equation becomes zero, the equation (3.26) can be written as

_U p Bm_\=‚àí (cos )Œ∏ (3.27)

The potential energy stored in a bar magnet in a uniform magnetic field is given by

**Case 1** (i) If _Œ∏_ \= 0o, then

_U p B pm m_\= ‚àí = ‚àí(cos ) B0ÔÅØ

(ii) If _Œ∏_ \= 180o, then

_U p B pm m_\= ‚àí =(cos ) B180ÔÅØ

_U U p Banti parallel imum m_‚àí = =‚àímax co  

From the above two results, We infer that the potential energy of the bar magnet is minimum when it is aligned along the external magnetic field and maximum when the bar magnet is aligned anti-parallel to external magnetic field.

**EXAMPLE 3.7**

Consider a magnetic dipole which on switching ON external magnetic field orient only in two possible ways i.e., one along the direction of the magnetic field (parallel to the field) and another anti-parallel to magnetic field. Compute the energy for the possible orientation.

**_Solution_**

Let ÔÅ≤_pm_ be the dipole and before switching ON the external magnetic field, there is no orientation. Therefore, the energy U = 0.

As soon as external magnetic field is switched ON, the magnetic dipole orient parallel (Œ∏ = 0o) to the magnetic field with energy,

since cos 0o = 1

Otherwise, the magnetic dipole orients anti-parallel (Œ∏ = 180o) to the magnetic field with energy,

_U U p B U p Banti parallel imum m anti parallel m_‚àí ‚àí= =‚àí ‚áí =max cos180

_U p Banti parallel m_‚àí‚áí =s180

since cos 180o = -1
