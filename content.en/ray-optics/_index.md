**INTRODUCTION**

Light is mystical. Yet, its behaviour is so fascinating. It is difficult to comprehend light as a single entity. The _ray optics_ deals with light that is represented as a ray travelling in straight lines. Here, the geometrical constructs get the permanence to understand some of the characteristics of light and the phenomena associated with it. There are several other phenomena which can only be explained using _wave optics_, which we study in the next Unit. There is also a quantum aspect of light which we can study as _quantum optics_ in graduate level courses.

### Ray optics

Light travels in a straight line in a medium. Light may deviate in its path only when it encounters the boundary of another medium (or) an obstacle. A ray of light gives information only about the direction of light. It does not give information about the other characteristics like intensity and colour of light. However, a ray is a sensible representation of light in ray optics. The path of the light is called a ray of light and a bundle of such rays is called a beam of light. In this chapter, we can explain the phenomena of reflection, refraction, dispersion and scattering of light, using the ray depiction of light.

### Reflection

**The bouncing back of light into the same medium when it encounters a reflecting surface is called _reflection_ of light**. Any polished surface can reflect light. Mirrors which are silver coated at their back can reflect almost 90% of the light falling on them. The angle of incidence _i_ and the angle of reflection _r_ are measured with respect to the normal drawn to the surface at the point
  

of incidence of light. **According to laws of reflection, (i) The incident ray, reflected ray and normal**

**to the reflecting surface are all coplanar (ie. lie in the same plane).**

**(ii) The angle of incidence _i_ is equal to the angle of reflection _r_.**

_i = r_ (6.1)

The law of reflection is shown in Figure 6.1.

![Reflection of light](6.1.png)

**Figure 6.1 Reflection of light**

The laws of reflection are valid at each point for any reflecting surface whether the surface is flat (or) curved. If the reflecting surface is flat, then incident parallel rays after reflection come out as parallel rays as shown in Figure 6.2(a). If the reflecting surface is irregular, then the incident parallel rays after reflection come out as irregular rays (not parallel rays). Still the laws of reflection are valid at every point of incidence in irregular reflection as shown in Figure 6.2(b).


![(a) Regular and (b) irregular reflections](6.2.png "")

### Angle of deviation due to reflection

**The angle between the direction of incident ray and the reflected ray is called _angle of deviation due to reflection_.** It is calculated by a simple geometry as shown in Figure 6.3(a). The incident light is AO. The reflected light is OB. The un-deviated light is OC which is the continuation of the incident light. The angle between OB and OC is the angle of deviation _d_. From the geometry, it is written as, _d_ = 180 – (_i_+_r_). As, _i_ = _r_ in reflection, we can write angle of deviation in reflection as,

_d =_ 180 _– 2i_ (6.2)

The angle of deviation can also be measured in terms of the glancing angle _α_ which is measured between the incident ray AO and the reflecting plane surface XY as shown in Figure 6.3(b). By geometry, the angles ∠_AOX_ = _α_, ∠_BOY_ = _α_ and ∠_YOC_ = _α_ (all are same). The angle of deviation _d_ is the angle ∠_BOC_. Therefore,

_d_ = 2α (6.3)
  

![Angle of deviation due to reflection](6.3.png "")


**EXAMPLE 6.1** Prove that for the same incident light when a reflecting surface is tilted by an angle _θ_, the reflected light will be tilted by an angle 2_θ_.

**_Solution_** _AB_ is the reflecting surface as shown in the Figure. Both the incident ray _IO_ and the reflected ray _OR_1 subtend angle i with the normal _N_ as the angle of incidence is equal to angle of reflection. When the surface _AB_ is tilted to ¢ ¢_A B_ by an angle _θ_, the normal _N_ is also is tilted to ′_N_ by the same angle _θ_. Remember that the position of the incident ray _IO_ remains unaltered. But the reflected ray now is _OR_2\. Now, in the tilted system, the angle of incidence, ∠_N'OI_ = _i+θ_ and the angle of reflection, ∠_N'OR_2 = _i+θ_ are the same. The angle between _ON'_ and _OR_1 is, ∠_N'OR_1 = _i_ – _θ_. The angle tilted on the reflected light is the angle between _OR_1 and _OR_2 which is ∠_R_1_OR_2\. From the geometry we can write,  

∠_R_1_OR_2 = ∠_N'OR_2 – ∠_N'OR_1 = (_i_+_θ_) – (_i_–_θ_) ∠_R_1_OR_2 = 2_θ_.




### Image formation in plane mirror

Let us consider a point object _A_ placed in front of a plane mirror. The point of incidence is _O_ on the mirror as shown in the Figure. 6.4(a).



![Formation of image in plane mirror for (a) point and (b) extended objects](6.4.png "")
  

A light ray _AO_ from the point object is incident on the mirror and it is reflected along _OB_. The normal is _ON_.

The angle of incidence ∠_AON_ = angle of reflection ∠_BON_

Another ray _AD_ incident normally on the mirror at _D_ is reflected back along _DA_. When _BO_ and _AD_ are extended backwards, they meet at a point _A'_. Thus, the rays appear to come from a point _A'_ which is behind the plane mirror. The object and its image are at equal perpendicular distances from the plane mirror which can be shown by the following explanation.

Angle ∠_AON_ = angle ∠_DAO_ \[Since they are alternate angles\]

Angle ∠_BON_ = angle ∠_O_ ¢_A D_ \[Since they are corresponding angles\]

Hence, it follows that angle, ∠_DAO_ = ∠_O_ ¢_A D_

The triangles ∆_ODA_ and ∆_OD_ ¢_A_ are congruent

∴ _AD_ = ¢_A D_ This shows that the image distance _di_

inside the plane mirror is equal to the object distance _do_ in front of the plane mirror.

The image formed by the plane mirror for extended object is shown in Figure 6.4(b).

### Characteristics of the image formed by plane mirror

(i) The image formed by a plane mirror is virtual, erect and laterally inverted sidewise (left / right).

(ii) The size of the image is equal to the size of the object.

(iii) The image distance behind the mirror is equal to the object distance in front of the mirror.

(iv) If an object is placed between two plane mirrors inclined at an angle _θ_, then the number of images _n_ formed is given in Table 6.1 the images formed are shown in Figure 6.5.  

**Table 6.1 Image by inclined mirrors**

![](Table-6.1.png "")


![Images formed by inclined mirrors](6.5.png "")

**EXAMPLE 6.2**

What is the height of the mirror needed for a person to see his/her image fully on the mirror?

**_Solution_** Let us assume a person of height _h_ is standing in front of a vertical plane mirror. The person could see his/her head when light from the head falls on the mirror and gets reflected to the eyes. Same way, light from the feet falls on the mirror and gets reflected to the eyes.

![](distance.png "")

If the distance between his head _H_ and eye _E_ is _h1_ and distance between his feet _F_ and eye _E_ is _h2_. The person’s total height is, _h._ Here it is, _h_ = _h1_ + _h2_

By the law of reflection, the angle of incidence and angle of reflection are the same for the two extreme reflections. The normals are now the bisectors of the angles between the incident and the reflected rays at the two points. By geometry, the height of the mirror needed is only half of the

height of the person. $\frac{h_1+h_2}{2} = \frac{h}{2}$



Does the height depend on the distance between the person and the mirror?

## 6.2 SPHERICAL MIRRORS

We shall now study about the reflections that take place in spherical surfaces.

A spherical surface is a part cut from a hollow sphere. Spherical mirrors are generally constructed using glass. One surface of the glass is silvered. The reflection takes place at the other surface which is polished. **If the polished surface of the mirror is convex it is called as _convex mirror._** These are shown in Figure 6.6.

We shall get familiarised with some of the terminologies pertaining to spherical mirrors.

![Spherical mirrors](6.6.1.png "")
![](6.6.2.png "")

**_Centre of curvature_**_:_ The centre of the sphere of which the mirror is a part is called the _centre of curvature C_ of the mirror.

**_Radius of curvature_**_:_ The radius of the sphere of which the spherical mirror is a part is called the _radius of curvature R_ of the mirror.

**_Pole_:** The middle point on the spherical surface of the mirror (or) the geometrical centre of the mirror is called _pole P_ of the mirror (or) optic centre.

**_Principal axis_**_:_ The line joining the pole _P_ and the centre of curvature _C_ is called the _principal axis_ of the mirror. The light ray travelling along the principal axis towards the mirror after reflection travels back along the same principal axis. It is also called optical axis

**_Focus (or) Focal point_**_:_ Light rays travelling parallel and close to the principal axis when incident on a spherical mirror, converge at a point for concave mirror (or) appear to diverge from a point for convex mirror on the principal axis. This point is called the _focus (_or) _focal point F_ of the mirror.

**_Focal length_**: The distance between the pole _P_ and the focus _F_ is called the _focal length f_ of the mirror.

**_Focal plane_**: The plane through the focus and perpendicular to the principal axis is called the _focal plane_ of the mirror.

All the above mentioned terms are shown in Figure 6.7 for both concave and convex mirrors.



![Representation of terminologies for (a) concave and (b) convex mirrors  ](6.7.png "")

### 6.2.1 Paraxial Rays and Marginal Rays

**The _paraxial rays_ are the rays which travel very close to the principal axis and make small angles with it**. They fall on the mirror very close to the pole. On the other hand, **the _marginal rays_ are the rays which travel far away from the principal axis and make large angles with it**. They fall on the mirror far away from the pole. These two rays behave differently (get focused at different points) as shown in Figure 6.8. In this chapter, we shall restrict our studies only to paraxial rays. As the angles made by the paraxial rays are very small, we can make good approximations.

![Paraxial and marginal rays](6.8.png "")

### Relation between _f_ and _R_

Let _C_ be the centre of curvature of the mirror. Consider a ray of light parallel to the principal axis is incident on the mirror at _M._ It passes through the principal focus _F_ after reflection. The geometry related to this is shown in Figure 6.9(a). The line _CM_ is the normal to the mirror at _M_. Let _i_ be the angle of incidence and the same will be the angle of reflection.



If _MP_ is the perpendicular from _M_ to the principal axis, then

The angles ∠_MCP_ = _i_ and ∠_MFP_ = 2_i_ From right angle triangles ∆_MCP_ and

∆_MFP,_ we can write,

tan_i PM PC_

\= and tan2_i PM PF_

\=

As the angles are small, tan _i i_≈ and tan 2_i_ tan _i_≈ 2_i_,

_i PM PC_

\= and 2_i PM PF_

\=

Simplifying further,




**(b) Convex Mirror**

![Relation between _f_ and _R_  ](6.9.png "")

_PF_ is focal length _f_ and _PC_ is the radius of curvature _R_.

2 2

_f R R_ \= =(or) f (6.4)

Equation (6.4) is the relation between _f_ and _R_. The construction is shown for convex mirror in figure 6.9(b)

### 6.2.3 Image formation in spherical mirrors

The image formed by spherical mirror can be found by ray construction called image tracing. To locate an image point, a minimum of two rays must meet at that point. We can use at least any two of the following four rays as shown in Figure 6.10.




![Image tracing](6.10.png "")

(i) A ray parallel to the principal axis after reflection will pass (or appear to pass) through the principal focus. (Figure 6.10(a))

(ii) A ray passing (or appear passing) through the principal focus, after reflection will travel parallel to the principal axis. (Figure 6.10(b))

(iii) A ray passing through the centre of curvature retraces its path after reflection as it is a normal incidence. (Figure 6.10(c))

  

(iv) A ray falling on the pole will get reflected as per law of reflection keeping principal axis as the normal. (Figure 6.10(d))

### 6.2.4 Cartesian sign convention

While tracing the image, we would normally come across the object distance _u_, the image distance _v_, the object height _h_, the image height ′_h_ , the focal length _f_ and the radius of curvature _R_. A system of signs for these quantities must be followed so that the relations connecting them are consistent in all types of physical situations. We shall follow the Cartesian sign convention which is now widely used. It is given below and also shown in Figure 6.11.

(i) The Incident light is taken as if it is travelling from left to right (i.e. object on the left of mirror).

(ii) All the distances are measured from the pole of the mirror (pole is taken as origin).

(iii) The distances measured to the right of pole along the principal axis are taken as positive.

(iv) The distances measured to the left of pole along the principal axis are taken as negative.

(v) Heights measured upwards perpendicular to the principal axis are taken as positive.

(vi) Heights measured downwards perpendicular to the principal axis, are taken as negative.

![Cartesian sign convention  ](6.11.png "")

### 6.2.5 Mirror equation

The mirror equation establishes a relation among object distance _u_, image distance _v_ and focal length _f_ for a spherical mirror.

An object _AB_ is considered on the principal axis of a concave mirror beyond the centre of curvature _C_. The image formation is shown in the Figure 6.12. Let us consider three paraxial rays from point _B_ on the object. The first paraxial ray _BD_ travells parallel to the principal axis. It is incident on the concave mirror at _D_, close to the pole _P_. It is reflected back through the focus _F_. The second paraxial ray _BP_ is incident at the pole _P._ It is reflected along _PB_´. The third paraxial ray _BC_ passing through centre of curvature _C_, falls normally on the mirror at _E._ It is reflected back along the same path. The three reflected rays intersect at the point ′ ′_A B_ . A perpendicular drawn as ′ ′_A B_ to the principal axis gives the real, inverted image.



![Mirror equation](6.12.png "")

As per law of reflection, the angle of incidence ∠_BPA_ is equal to the angle of reflection ∠ _BPA_ .

The triangles ∆ _BPA_ and ∆ _BPA_ are similar. Thus, from the rule of similar triangles,

$$
\frac{A' \cdot B'}{AB} = \frac{PA'}{PA}
$$

The other set of similar triangles are, ∆_DPF_ and ∆ _BAF_ . (_PD_ is almost a straight vertical line)

$$
\frac{A' \cdot B'}{AB} = \frac{A'F}{PF}
$$

From equations (6.5) and (6.6) we can write,

$$
\frac{P \cdot A'}{PA} = \frac{A'F}{PF}
$$

As, ′ ′_A F= PA - PF_ , the above equation becomes,
$$
\frac{PA'}{PA} = \frac{PA'-PF}{PF}
$$

We can apply the sign conventions for the various distances in the above equation.

_PA_=_u_,_PA'_=_-v_,_PF_=-f_
 All the three distances are negative as per sign convention, because they are measured to the left of the pole. Now, the equation (6.7) becomes.

_v u_

_v f f_ ( )

On further simplification, _v u_

_v f f_

_v u_

_v f_

\= −

\= −; 1

Dividing both sides with v,

1 1 1 _u f v_ \= −

After rearranging,

1 1 1 _v u f_ \+ = (6.8)

The equation (6.8) is called **_mirror equation_**. Although this equation is derived for a special situation shown in Figure (6.12), it is also valid for all other situations with any spherical mirror. This is because proper sign convention is followed for _u_, _v_ and _f_ in equation (6.7).  

### Lateral magnification in spherical mirrors

**The _lateral_ (or) _transverse_ magnification _m_ is defined as the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the object**.The height of the object and image are measured perpendicular to the principal axis.

On simplifying we get,

Using mirror equation, we can further write the magnification as,

_m h h_

_f v f_

_f f u_

\= ′ = − = −

(6.11)

The students are advised to refresh themselves with the image tracing

for the concave and convex mirrors for various predetermined positions of the object; the position of image, nature of image etc., from 9th Standard, Science Book .

**Note**

**EXAMPLE 6.3**

An object is placed at a distance of 20.0 cm from a concave mirror of focal length 15.0 cm.
  

(a) What distance from the mirror a screen should be placed to get a sharp image? (b) What is the nature of the image?

**_Solution_** Given, _f_ = –15 cm, _u_ = –20 cm

(a) Mirror equation, 1 1 1 _v u f_ \+ =

Rewriting to find v, 1 1 1 _v f u_ \= −

Substituting for f and u, 1 1 15



The screen is to be placed at distance 60.0 cm to the left of the concave mirror.

(b) Magnification, _m h h_



As the sign of magnification is negative, the image is inverted. As the magnitude of magnification is 3, the image is enlarged three times. As the image is formed to the left of the concave mirror, the image is real.

**EXAMPLE 6.4**

A thin rod of length _f_ /3 is placed along the optical axis of a concave mirror of focal length _f_ such that one end of image which is real and elongated just touches the respective end of the rod. Calculate the longitudinal magnification.

**_Solution_**

( ) = (ĺ ) (_l_)  

Given: length of object, _l_ = _f_ 3

For the given condition, the image formation is shown in the figure.



Let, _l'_ be the length of the image, then

Image of one end coincides with the respective end of object. Thus, the coinciding end must be at centre of curvature.




## SPEED OF LIGHT

Light travels with the highest speed in vacuum. The speed of light in vacuum is denoted as _c_ and its value is, _c_ = 3 × 108 m s-1. The earliest attempt to determine the speed of light was made by a French scientist Hippolyte Fizeau (1819–1896). That paved way for the other scientists too to determine the speed of light.

### Fizeau’s method to determine speed of light

_Apparatus_: The apparatus used by Fizeau for determining speed of light in air medium is shown in Figure 6.13. The light from the source _S_ was first allowed to fall on a partially silvered glass plate _G_ kept at an angle of 45o to the incident light. The light then was allowed to pass through a rotating toothed-wheel with _N_ teeth and _N_ cuts of equal widths whose speed of rotation could be varied through an external mechanism (not shown in the Figure). The light passing through one cut

![Speed of light by Fizeau’s method  ](6.13.png "")

in the wheel will get reflected by a mirror _M_ kept at a long distance _d_, about 8 _km_ from the toothed-wheel. If the toothed- wheel was not rotating, the light reflected back from the mirror would again pass through the same cut and reach the eyes of the observer who looks through the partially silvered glass plate.

_Working_: The angular speed of rotation of the toothed-wheel was increased from zero to a value _ω_ until the light passing through one cut would completely be blocked by the adjacent tooth. This is ensured by the disappearance of the light while looking through the partially silvered glass plate.

_Expression for speed of light_: The speed _v_ of light in air is equal to the ratio of the distance 2_d_ (the distance light travelled from the toothed-wheel to the mirror and back), to the time taken _t_.

_v_ \= 2_d t_

(6.12)

The distance _d_ is a known value from the arrangement. The time _t_ taken for the



  

light to travel the distance 2_d_ is calculated from the angular speed _ω_ of the toothed- wheel.

The angular speed _ω_ (with unit rad s–1) of the toothed-wheel when the light disappeared for the first time is,

_w q_ \=

_t_ (6.13)

Here, _θ_ is the angle between one tooth and the next slot which is turned within that time _t_.

_q_ \= total angle of the circle in radian number of teeth+number of cuts

_q p p_\= 2 2_N N_

\=

Substituting _θ_ in equation (6.13),

_w p p_\= / _N t Nt_

\=

Rewriting the above equation for t,

_t N_

\= _p w_

(6.14)

Substituting this in equation (6.12),

_v_ \= 2_d Np w_/

After rearranging,

_v_ \= 2_dNw p_

(6.15)

Fizeau had some difficulty to visually estimate the minimum intensity of the light when it is blocked by the adjacent tooth. The value of speed of light determined by him was very close to the actual value. Later on, with the same idea of Fizeau and with much sophisticated instruments, the speed of light in air was determined as, _v_ = 2.99792 × 108 m s–1.  

After the disappearance of light for the first time while increasing the speed

of rotation of the toothed-wheel from zero to ω, on further increasing the speed of rotation to 2_ω_, the light would appear again due to the passing of reflected light through the next slot. So, for every odd value of ω, light would disappear (stopped by tooth) and for every even value of ω light would appear (allowed by slot).

**Note**

### Speed of light through vacuum and different media

Scientists like Foucault (1819–1868) and Michelson (1852–1931) introduced different transparent media like glass, water etc., in the path of light to find the speed of light in different media. Even evacuated glass tubes were also introduced in the path of light to find the speed of light in vacuum. It was found that light travels with lesser speed in any medium than its speed in vacuum. The speed of light in vacuum was determined as, _c_ = 3 × 108 m s-1. We could notice that the speed of light in vacuum and speed of light in air are almost same.

### Refractive index

**_Refractive index_ of a transparent medium is defined as the ratio of speed of light in vacuum _c_ to the speed of light in that medium** _v_**.**

refractive index _n_ of a

medium =

speedof light in vacuum speedof light inmedium

( ) ( ) _c v_
  

_n c_\= _v_

(6.16)

Refractive index of a transparent medium gives an idea about the speed of light in that medium.

**EXAMPLE 6.5**

Light travels with a speed of 2.26 × 108 m s-1 through pure water.

Refractive index does not have a unit. The smallest value of refractive index is for vacuum, which is 1. For any other medium refractive index is greater than 1. Refractive index is also called as optical density of the medium. Higher the refractive index of a medium, lesser is the speed of light through it and vice-versa. \[Note: optical density should not be confused with mass density of the material of the medium. They two are different entities\]. The Table 6.2 shows the refractive indices of different transparent media.

**Table 6.2 Refractive index of media**

### Optical path

**_Optical path_ of a medium is defined as the distance _d'_ light travels in vacuum in the same time it travels a distance _d_ in the medium.**

Let us consider a medium of refractive index _n_ and thickness _d_. Light travels with a speed _v_ through the medium in a time _t_. The speed of light through the medium is written as,

_v v_

\= = _d t_

_t t d_; ,rewrittenfor as

In the same time _t_, light can cover a longer distance _d'_ in vacuum as it travels with greater speed _c_ in vacuum. It is shown in Figure 6.14. Now, we can wrtite,

The value of _n_ is always greater than 1, for a medium. Thus, the optical path _d'_ of a medium is always greater than _d_.

**EXAMPLE 6.6**

Light travels from air into a glass slab of thickness 50 cm and refractive index 1.5.

(a) What is the speed of light in the glass slab?

(b) What is the time taken by the light to travel through the glass slab?

(c) What is the optical path of the glass slab?

## REFRACTION

**Refraction is passing of light from one optical medium to another optical medium through a boundary**. In refraction, the angle of incidence _i_ in one medium and the angle of refraction _r_ in the other medium are measured with respect to the normal drawn to the surface at the point of incidence of light. According to laws of refraction, **(i) The incident ray, refracted ray and**

**normal to the refracting surface are all coplanar (ie. lie in the same plane).**

**(ii) The ratio of sine of angle of incident _i_ in the first medium to the sine of angle of refraction _r_ in the second medium is equal to the ratio of refractive index _n_2 of the second medium to the refractive index _n_1 of the first medium.**

For normal incidence of light on a surface, the angle of incidence is zero.

**Note**

### Angle of deviation due to refraction

**The angle between the direction of incident ray and the refracted ray is called _angle of deviation due to refraction_.** When light travels from rarer to denser medium, it deviates towards normal as shown in Figure 6.16. The angle of deviation in this case is,

_d_ = _i_ – _r_ (6.20)

![Angle of deviation due to refraction from rarer to denser medium  ](6.16.png "")

On the other hand, if light travels from denser to rarer medium, it deviates away from normal as shown in Figure 6.17. The angle of deviation in this case is,

_d_ = _r_ – _i_ (6.21)

### simultaneous reflection (or) refraction

In any refracting surface there will also be some reflection taking place. Thus, the intensity of refracted light will be lesser than the incident light. **The phenomenon in which a part of light from a source undergoing reflection and the other part of light from the same source undergoing refraction at the same surface is called _simultaneous reflection (_or) _simultaneous refraction_.** This is shown in Figure 6.18. Such surfaces are available as partially silvered glasses.

### Principle of reversibility

**The _principle of reversibility_ states that light will follow exactly the same path if its direction of travel is reversed.** This is true for both reflection and refraction as shown in Figure 6.19.

Production of optical surfaces capable of refracting as well as reflecting is possible

by properly coating the surfaces with suitable materials. Thus, a glass can be made partially see through and partially reflecting. These glasses are commercially called as two-way mirror, half-silvered mirror, semi-silvered mirror etc. This gives a perception of regular mirror if the other side is made dark. But, still hidden cameras can be kept behind such mirrors. We need to be cautious when we stand in front of mirrors kept in unknown places. T method to test the two way mirror.

### Apparent depth

It is a common observation that the bottom of a tank filled with water appears to be raised when seen from air medium above as shown in Figure 6.19(a). An equation could be derived for the apparent depth when viewed in the near normal direction.

Light from the object _O_ at the bottom of the tank passes from denser medium (water) to rarer medium (air) to reach our eyes for viewing the object as shown in Figure 6.20 (b). It deviates away from the normal in the rarer medium at the point of incidence _B_ as shown in Figure 6.20 (c). The refractive index of the denser medium is _n_1 and that of rarer medium is _n_2\. Here, _n_1 > _n_2\. The angle of incidence in the denser medium is _i_ and the angle of refraction in the rarer medium is _r_. The lines _NN_ ′ and _OD_ are parallel. Thus, the angle ∠_DIB_ is also _r_. The angles _i_ and _r_ are very small as the diverging light from _O_ entering the eye is very narrow. The Snell’s law in product form for this refraction from equation (6.19) is,

### Critical angle and total internal reflection

When a ray passes from an optically denser medium to an optically rarer medium, it bends away from the normal. Because of this, the angle of refraction _r_ in the rarer medium is greater than the corresponding angle of incidence _i_ in  

the denser medium. As angle of incidence _i_ is gradually increased, _r_ rapidly increases and at a certain stage _r_ becomes 90° and the refracted ray will be gracing the boundary. **The angle of incidence in the denser medium for which the angle of refraction is 90° (or) the refracted ray graces the boundary between the two media is called _critical angle ic_**.

If the angle of incidence in the denser medium is increased beyond the critical angle, there is no refraction possible in to the rarer medium. **For any angle of incidence greater than the critical angle, the entire light is reflected back into the denser medium itself. This phenomenon is called _total internal reflection_.** These are shown in Figure 6.21.

The two conditions for total internal reflection to take place are, (i) light must travel from denser to rarer

medium, (ii) angle of incidence in the denser medium

must be greater than critical angle (_i>ic_).

For critical angle of incidence, the Snell’s law in the product form, equation (6.19) becomes,

### Effects due to total internal reflection

**6.4.7.1 Glittering of diamond** Diamond appears dazzling because of

the total internal reflection of light that happens inside the diamond. The refractive index of diamond is about 2.417. It is much greater than the refractive index of ordinary glass which is about only 1.5. The critical angle of diamond is about 24.4°. It is much less than that of ordinary glass. A skilled diamond cutter makes use of this larger range of angle of incidence (24.4° to 90° inside the diamond), to ensure that light entering the diamond is total internally reflected from the many cut faces before getting out as shown in Figure 6.22. This gives a sparkling effect for diamond.

**6.4.7.2 Mirage and looming** The refractive index of air increases

with its density. In hot places, air near the ground is hotter than air at a height. Hot air is less dense. Hence, in still air the refractive index of air increases with height. Because of this, the light from tall objects like a tree, try to pass through a medium whose refractive index decreases towards the ground. Hence, the ray of light successively deviates away from the normal at different layers of air and undergoes total internal reflection when the angle of incidence near the ground exceeds the critical angle. This gives an illusion as if the light comes from somewhere below the ground. Because of the shaky nature of the layers of air, the observer feels as if

the object is getting reflected by a pool of water (or) wet surface beneath the object as shown in Figure 6.23(a). This phenomenon is called **_mirage_**.

In the cold places the refractive index increases towards the ground because the temperature of air close to the ground is lesser than the temperature at a height above the surface of earth. Thus, the density and refractive index of air close to the ground is greater than for air at a height. In the cold regions like glaciers and frozen lakes, the reverse effect of mirage will happen. Hence, an inverted image is formed little above the surface as shown in Figure 6.23(b). This phenomenon is called **_looming_**. It is also called as superior mirage, towering and stooping.

**6.4.7.3 Prisms making using of total internal reflection**

In the first two cases, the critical angle _ic_ for the material of the prism must be less than 45o. Prism in Figure 6.24(b) inverts the object on the same side. Prism in Figure 6.24(c) inverts the object on the other side.

**6.4.7.4 Radius of illumination (Snell’s window)**

![Light source inside water tank](6.25.png "")

When a source of light like electric bulb is kept inside a water tank, the light from the source travels in all direction inside the water. The light that is incident on the water surface at an angle less than the critical angle will undergo refraction and emerge out from the water. The light incident at an angle greater than critical angle will undergo total internal reflection.The light falling particularly at critical angle graces the surface. Thus, the entire surface of water appears illuminated when seen from outside as shown in Figure 6.25.

On the other hand, when the light entering the water from outside is seen from inside the water, the view is restricted to a particular angle equal to the critical angle _ic_. The restricted illuminated circular area is called _Snell’s window_ as shown in Figure 6.26(a).The Figure 6.26(b) shows the angle of view for water animals.  

**(a)**

**icic**

**(b)**

![(a) Snell’s window and (b) angle of view for water animals](6.26.png "")

The angle of view for water animals is restricted to twice the critical angle 2_ic_. The critical angle for water is 48.6o. Thus the angle of view is 97.2o. The radius _R_ of the circular area depends on the depth _d_ from which it is seen and also the refractive index _n_ of the medium. The radius _R_ of Snell’s window can be deduced with the illustration as shown in Figure 6.27.

**6.4.7.5 Optical fibre** Transmitting the signals through optical

fibres is possible due to the phenomenon of total internal reflection. **Optical fibres consist of inner part called _core_ and outer part called _cladding_ (or) _sleeving_.** The refractive index of the core must be higher than that of the cladding for total internal reflection to happen. Signal in the form of light is made to incident inside the core- cladding boundary at an angle greater than
  

the critical angle. Hence, it advances with repeated total internal reflections inside the optical fibre without undergoing any refraction. The light travels inside the core with no appreciable loss in the intensity of the light as shown in Figure 6.28(a). While bending the optical fibre, it is done in such a way that the condition for total internal reflection is ensured at every reflection inside the fibre as shown in Figure 6.28(b).

**in the core-cladding boundary inside the optical fibre, the light should be incident at a certain angle called** **_acceptance angle_ at the end of the optical fibre while entering into it.** It depends on the refractive indices of the core _n_1, cladding _n_2 and the outer medium _n_3\. Assume that the light is incident at an angle called acceptance angle _ia_ at the outer medium-core boundary at _A_ as shown in Figure 6.29(a).

Even operations could be carried out with the endoscope cables which have the necessary instruments attached at their ends.

### Refraction in glass slab

When a ray of light enters a slab it travels from rarer medium (air) to denser medium (glass). This results in deviation of the ray towards the normal. When the light ray leaves the slab it travels from denser medium (glass) to rarer medium (air) resulting in deviation of the ray away from the normal. After the two refractions,  

the light ray emerges in the same direction as that of the incident ray on the glass slab with a lateral displacement (or) shift _L_. i.e. There is no change in the direction of the ray but, the path of the incident ray and refracted ray are parallel to each other with a shift L, as shown in Figure 6.30.

Consider a glass slab of thickness _t_ and refractive index _n_ kept in air medium. If the path of the light is _ABCD,_ the refractions occur at two points _B_ and _C_ in the glass slab. The angles of incidence _i_ and refraction _r_ are measured with respect to the normal _N_1 and _N_2 at the two points _B_ and _C_ respectively. The lateral displacement _L_ is the perpendicular distance _CE_ drawn between the paths of the deviated light and the undeviated light at point _C_.

The lateral displacement depends upon (i) the thickness of the slab, (ii) the angle of incidence and (iii) the refractive index of the slab which decides the angel of refraction. Thicker the slab, larger will be the lateral displacement. Greater the angle of incidence, larger will be the lateral displacement. Higher the refractive index, larger will be the lateral displacement.

**EXAMPLE 6.11**

The thickness of a glass slab is 0.25 m. It has a refractive index of 1.5. A ray of light is incident on the surface of the slab at an angle of 60o. Find the lateral displacement of the light when it emerges from the other side of the glass slab.

## REFRACTION AT SINGLE SPHERICAL SURFACE

We have so far studied only the refraction at plane surface. The refraction can also take place at spherical surface between two transparent media. The laws of refraction hold good at every point on the spherical surface. The normal at the point of incidence is perpendicular drawn to the tangent plane of the spherical surface at that point. Therefore, the normal always passes through its center of curvature. The study of refraction at single spherical surface paves way to the understanding of thin lenses which consist of two refracting surfaces.

The following assumptions are made while considering refraction at spherical surfaces. (i) The incident light is assumed to be

monochromatic (single colour) (ii) The incident light is very close to the

principal axis (paraxial rays). The sign conventions are similar to that

of the spherical mirrors.

### Equation for refraction at single spherical surface

Let us consider two transparent media with refractive indices _n_1 and _n_2 which are separated by a spherical surface as shown in Figure 6.31. Let _C_ be the centre of curvature of the spherical surface. Let a point object _O_ be in the medium _n_1\. The line _OC_ is the principal axis that cuts the spherical surface at the pole P. As the rays considered are paraxial rays, the perpendicular dropped from the point of incidence to the principal axis is very close to the pole (or) passes through the pole itself.

![Refraction at single spherical surface](6.31.png "")

Light from _O_ falls on the refracting surface at _N_. The normal drawn to the refracting surface at the point of incidence passes through the centre of curvature _C_. As _n_2>_n_1, light in the denser medium deviates towards the normal and meets the principal axis at _I_ where the image is formed.

Snell’s law in product form for the refraction at the point _N_ can be written from equation (6.19),

_n i n r_1 2sin sin=

As the angles are small, sine of the angle could be approximated to the angle itself.

## THIN LENS

A lens is formed by a transparent material bounded between two spherical surfaces (or) one plane and another spherical surface. In a thin lens, the distance between the surfaces is very small. For two spherical surfaces, there will be two centres of curvature _C_1 and _C_2 and correspondingly two radii of curvature _R_1 and _R_2\. For a plane surface, the centre of curvature _C_ is at infinity and

**6.6**  

its radius of curvature _R_ is infinity (_R_ = ∞). The terminologies of spherical mirrors hold good very much for thin lenses except for the focal length.

### Primary and secondary focus

As the thin lens is formed by two surfaces, the lens may separate two different media. i.e. the media to the left and right of the lens may be different. Hence, we have two focal lengths.

**The _primary focus F_1 is defined as a point where a point source kept produces a parallel emergent rays to the principal axis after passing through lens** as shown in Figure 6.32. For a converging lens, such an object is a real object and for a diverging lens, it is a virtual object. The distance _PF_1 is the _primary focal length f_1_._

**F1 P P F1**

![Primary focus](6.32.png "")

**The _secondary focus_ _F_2 is defined as a point where all the parallel rays travelling close to the principal axis converge to form an image on the principal axis** **after passing through lens** as shown in Figure 6.33. For a converging lens, such an image is a real image and for a diverging lens, it is a virtual image. The distance _PF_2 is the secondary focal length _f_2.

If the media on the two sides of a thin lens have same refractive index, then the two focal lengths are equal. We will mostly be using the secondary focus _F_2 in our further discussions.

### Sign conventions on focal length for lens

The sign conventions for thin lenses differ only in the signs followed for focal lengths.

(i) The sign of focal length is _not decided_ on the direction of measurement of the focal length from the pole of the lens as they have two focal lengths, one to the left and another to the right.

(ii) The focal length of the thin lens is taken as positive for a converging lens and negative for a diverging lens.

The other sign conventions for object distance, image distance, radius of curvature, object height and image height (except for the focal lengths as mentioned above) remain the same for thin lenses as that of spherical mirrors.

### Lens maker’s formula and lens equation

Let us consider a thin lens made up of a medium of refractive index _n_2 placed in a medium of refractive index _n_1\. Let _R_1 and _R_2 be the radii of curvature of two spherical surfaces  and  respectively and _P_ be the pole as shown in Figure 6.34. Consider a point object _O_ on the principal axis. A paraxial ray from _O_ which falls very close to _P_, after refraction at the surface  forms image at _I'_. Before it does so, it is again refracted by the surface . Therefore, the final image is formed at _I_.  

The general equation for the refraction at a single spherical surface is given by the equation (6.56) is,

The above formula is called as the **_lens maker’s formula_**, because it tells the lens manufactures what curvature is needed for a material of particular refractive index to make a lens of desired focal length. This formula holds good also for any type of lens. By comparing the equations (6.60) and (6.61) we can write,

1 1 1 _v u f_ \- = (6.63)

The above equation is known as **_lens equation_** which relates the object distance _u_ and image distance _v_ with the focal length _f_ of the lens. This equation holds good for any type of lens.

### Lateral magnification in thin lens

Let us consider an object _OO'_ of height _h_1 placed on the principal axis with its height perpendicular to the principal axis. The inverted real image _II_ ′ is formed which has a height _h_2 as shown in Figure 6.35.

After rearranging,

\= ′ = (6.66)

The magnification is negative for real image and positive for virtual image. In the case of a concave lens, the magnification is always positive and less than one.

We can also have the other forms of equations for magnification by combining the lens equation as,

As the focal length is positive, the lens is a converging lens.

### Power of a lens

The power of a lens is a measure of its deviating ability on an incident light. When a ray is incident on a lens then the degree with which the lens deviates the ray is determined

by the power of the lens. Power of the lens is inversely proportional to the focal length i.e. greater the power of lens, smaller will be the focal length. In Figure 6.36, the lens (b) has greater deviating ability than lens (a). As (b) has greater deviating ability, its focal length is less and vice versa.

In other words, **the _power_ of a lens is a measure of the degree of convergence (or) divergence the lens produces on the light falling on it**. The power of a lens _P_ is the reciprocal of its focal length in meter.

_P f_

\= 1 (6.68)

The unit of power is dioptre (D). 1 D = 1 m–1. Power is positive for converging lens and negative for diverging lens.

From the lens maker's formula, equation (6.62), the equation (6.68) can be written for power as ,

The outcome of this equation for power is that for a given geomentry of the lens, larger the value of refractive index, greater is the power of lens and vice versa. Also for lenses with small radii of curvature (bulky) the power is large and for lenses with large radii of curvature (skinny), the power is small.

**EXAMPLE 6.15**

If the focal length is 150 cm for a lens, what is the power of the lens?

### Focal length of lenses in contact

Let us consider two lenses  and  of focal lengths _f_1 and _f_2 placed coaxially in contact with each other so that they have a common principal axis. For a point object placed at O beyond the focus of the lens  on the principal axis, an image is formed by it at _I'_. This image _I'_ acts as an object for the lens  and the final image is formed at _I_ as shown in Figure. 6.37. As these two lenses are thin, the measurements are done with respect to the common optic centre _P_ between the two lenses.

For the lens _,_ the object distance _PO_ is _u_ and the image distance _PI'_ is _v_′. For the lens , the object distance _PI'_ is _v_′ and the image distance _PI_ is _v_.

Writing the lens equation (6.63) for lens ,

_v u f_ (6.70)

Writing the lens equation (6.63) for lens ,

Adding the above two equations (6.70) and (6.71) gives,

1 1 1 1

1 2_v u f f_ − = + (6.72)

The combination acts as a single lens of focal length _f_ so that for an object at the position _O,_ it forms the image at _I._ Then,

1 1 1 _v u f_ − = (6.73)

Comparing the equations (6.72) and (6.73) we can write,

1 1 1

1 2_f f f_ \= + (6.74)

The above equation can be extended for any number of lenses in contact as,

1 1 1 1 1

1 2 3 4_f f f f f_ \= + + + + ......... (6.75)

The above equation can be written in terms of power of the lenses as,

_P P P P P_\= + + + +1 2 3 4 ......... (6.76)

Where, _P_ is the net power of the lenses in contact. One should note that the sum in equation (6.76) is an algebraic sum. The powers of individual lenses may be positive (for convex lenses) and negative (for concave lenses). Combination of lenses helps to obtain converging (or) diverging lenses of desired magnification. Also, combination of lenses enhances the sharpness of the image. As the image formed by the first lens becomes the object for the second and so on, the total magnification _m_ of the combination is the a product of magnification of individual lenses. We can now write,

_m_ = _m_1 × _m_2 × _m_3 . . . . . (6.77)

### Silvered lenses

If one of the surfaces of a lens is silvered from outside, then such a lens is said to be a silvered lens. A silvered lens is a combination of a lens and a mirror. Light can enter through the transparent front surface of the lens and get reflected by the silver coated rear surface. Hence, light travels two times through the lens as shown in Figure 6.38.

![Slivered lens](6.38.png "")

The power _P_ of the silvered lens is,

_P = Pl + Pm + Pl_

_P =_ 2_Pl + Pm_ (6.78)

Here, _Pl_ is the power of the lens and _Pm_ is the power of the mirror. We know that the power of a lens is the reciprocal of its focal length. But, the power of a mirror is negative of the reciprocal of its focal length. This is because, a concave mirror which has negative focal length is

a converging mirror with positive power. Also, a silvered lens is basically a modified mirror. Thus,

## PRISM

A prism is a triangular block of transparent glass. It is bounded by the three plane faces. Its one face is rough which is called base of the prism. The other two faces are polished which are called refracting faces of the prism. The angle between the two refracting faces is called angle of the prism (or) refracting angle (or) apex angle. It is represented as _A_ in Figure 6.39.

### Angle of deviation produced by prism

Consider a prism _ABC._ The faces _AB_ and _AC_ are polished and the face _BC_ is rough. Let light ray _PQ_ is incident on one of the refracting faces of the prism as shown in Figure 6.40. The angles of incidence and refraction at the first face _AB_ are _i_1 and _r_1\. The path of the light inside the prism is _QR_. The angles of incidence and refraction at the

**6.7**

_a_  

second face _AC_ is _r_2 and _i_2 respectively. RS is the ray emerging from the second face. Angle _i_2 is also called as angle of emergence. **The angle between the direction of incident ray and the emergent ray is called the _angle of deviation d_ in a prism**. The two normals drawn at the point of incidence _Q_ and at the point of emergence _R_ meet at point _N_. The extended incident ray and the emergent ray meet at point _M_.

The angle of deviation _d_1 at surface _AB_ is,

The angle of deviation _d_2 at surface _AC_ is,

_angle QRM d i r_∠ = = −2 2 2 (6.82)

Total angle of deviation _d_ produced is,

_d d d_\= +1 2 (6.83)

Substituting _d_1 and _d_2, in equation (6.83)

_d_ = (_i_1 – _r_1) + (_i_2 – _r_2)

After rearranging,

_d i i r r_\= + − +( ) ( )1 2 1 2 (6.84)

In the quadrilateral _AQNR_, two of the angles (at the vertices _Q_ and _R_) are right angles. Therefore, the sum of the other angles of the quadrilateral should be 180o.

∠_A_ + ∠_QNR_ = 180º (6.85)

In the triangle ∆_QNR_,

_r_1+ _r_2+ ∠_QNR_ = 180o (6.86)

Comparing the two equations (6.85) and (6.86) we get,

_r r A_1 2+ = (6.87)

Substituting this in equation (6.84) for angle of deviation,

_d i i A_\= + −1 2 (6.88)

Thus, the angle of deviation depends on the angle of incidence _i_1, angle of emergence _i_2 and the angle for the prism _A_. But, for a given angle of incidence, the angle of emergence is decided by the refractive index of the material of the prism. Hence, the angle of deviation for a monochromatic light depends on these following factors. (i) the angle of incidence (ii) the angle of the prism (iii) the refractive index of the material of

the prism (which decides the angle of emergency).

**EXAMPLE 6.19**

A monochromatic light is incident on an equilateral prism at an angle 30o and is emergent at an angle of 75o. What is the angle of deviation produced by the prism?

### Angle of minimum deviation

A graph plotted between the angle of incidence and angle of deviation is shown in Figure 6.41. One could observe that the angle of deviation decreases with increase in angle of incidence and reaches a minimum value _D_ and then continues to increase.

![Graph between _i_ and _d_](6.41.png "")

**The minimum value of angle of deviation is called angle of _minimum deviation D_. At minimum deviation**,

(i) the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of emergence, _i_1 = _i_2.

(ii) the angle of refraction at the face one and face two are equal, _r_1 = _r_2).

### Dispersion of white light through prism

The angle of deviation produced by a prism is so far discussed only for monochromatic light (i.e. light of single colour). When white light enter in to a prism, an effect called _dispersion_ takes place. **Dispersion is splitting of white light into its constituent colours. This band of colours of light is called its** **_spectrum_**. When a narrow beam of parallel rays of white light is incident on a prism and the refracted beam is received on a white screen. A band of colours is obtained in the order, recollected by the word: VIBGYOR i.e., Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange and Red. The violet is the most deviated colour and red is the least deviated colour as shown in Figure 6.43.

![Dispersion of white light in to its constituent colours](6.43.png "")

The colours obtained in a spectrum depend on the nature of the light source. Each colour in vacuum has a definite wavelength. The red colour has the longest wavelength of 700 nm while the violet  

colour has the shortest wavelength of 400 nm in vacuum. Though all the colours have different wavelengths, they all travel with the same speed in vacuum. The speed of light is independent of wavelength in vacuum. Therefore, vacuum is a non- dispersive medium.

Sir Isaac Newton has demonstrated through a classic experiment to produce white light by recombining all the colours of VIBGYOR. He used a prism to produce dispersion and made all the colours to incident on another inverted prism to combine all the colours to get white light as shown in figure.

**Points to Ponder**

But, when the white light enters a medium the red colour travels with the highest speed and violet colour travels with least speed. Hence, the wavelengths of colours in a medium are no longer the same as they are in vacuum. Actually, the dispersion takes place in a medium because of the difference in speed for different colours in a medium. In other words, the refractive index of the material of the prism is different for different colours. For violet colour, the refractive index is the highest and for red colour the refractive index is the least. The refractive index of two different glasses for different colours is shown in Table 6.4.

**Table 6.4 Refractive indices for different wavelengths**

| **Colour** | **Wavelength in vacuum (nm)** | **Crown glass** | **Flint glass** |

### Dispersive Power

Consider a beam of white light passing through a prism. It gets dispersed into its constituent colours as shown in Figure 6.44.

If the angle of prism is small of the order of 10o, the prism is said to be a

When white light enters the prism, the deviation is different for different colours. Thus, the refractive index is also different for different colours.

Let _δV_, _δR_ are the angles of minimum deviation for violet and red colour. Let _nV_ and _nR_ be the refractive indices for the violet and red colour respectively.

For Violet colour, _dV Vn A_\= −( )1 (6.92)

For Red colour, _dR Rn A_\= −( )1 (6.93)

As, angle of minimum deviation for violet colour _δV_ is greater than angle of minimum deviation for red colour _δR_, the refractive index for violet colour _nV_ is greater than the refractive index for red colour _nR_.

Subtracting _δR_ from _δV_ we get,

_δV_– _δR_ \= (_nV_–_nR_)_A_ (6.94)

**The angular separation between the two extreme colours (violet and red) in the spectrum (_δV_–_δR_) is called the _angular dispersion_**.  

If we take _δ_ as the angle of minimum deviation for any mean colour (green or yellow) and _n_ the corresponding refractive index. Then,

_δ_ \= (_n_ – 1)_A_ (6.95)

**_Dispersive power ω is defined as the ratio of the angular dispersion for the extreme colours to the deviation for any middle colour._** Dispersive power is the ability of the material of the prism to produce dispersion.

The dispersive power is a dimensionless and unitless quantity. The dispersive power is always positive. The dispersive power of a prism depends only on the nature of material of the prism and it is independent of the angle of the prism.

**EXAMPLE 6.22**

Find the dispersive power of a prism if the refractive indices of flint glass for red, green and violet colours are 1.613, 1.620 and 1.632 respectively.

**_Solution_** Given, _nV_\=1.632; _nR_\=1.613; _nG_\=1.620 Equation for dispersive power is,

### Scattering of sunlight

When sunlight enters the atmosphere of earth, the particles present in the atmosphere change the direction of the light. This process is known as scattering of light.

**If the scattering of light is by atoms and molecules which have size _a_ very much less than that of the wave length _λ_ of light, (_a_<<_λ_), then the scattering is called _Rayleigh’s scattering_**. The intensity of light scattered in Rayleigh’s scattering is inversely proportional to fourth power of wavelength.

_I_ µ 1 4_l_ (6.98)

According to equation 6.89, during day time, violet colour which has the shortest wavelength gets more scattered then the other colours. The next scattered colour is blue. As our eyes are more sensitive to blue colour than violet colour, the sky appears blue during day time as shown in Figure 6.45(b). But, during sunrise and sunset, the light from sun travels a greater distance through the atmosphere. Hence, the blue light which has shorter wavelength is scattered away and the red light which has longer wavelength and less-scattered manages to reach our eye. This is the reason for the reddish appearance of sky during sunrise and sunset as shown in Figure 6.45(a).

If light is scattered by large particles like dust and water droplets present in the atmosphere which have size _a_ greater than the wavelength _λ_ of light, (_a_ >> _λ_), the intensity of scattering is equal for all the colours. This non-Rayleigh’s scattering is independent of wavelength. It happens in clouds which contains large amount  

of dust and water droplets. Thus, in clouds all the colours get equally scattered. This is the reason for the whitish appearance of cloud as shown in Figure 6.45(c). But, the rain clouds appear dark because of the condensation of water droplets on dust particles that makes the cloud opaque.

If earth has no atmosphere there would not have been any scattering and the sky would appear dark. That is why sky appears dark for the astronauts who could see the sky from above the atmosphere.
